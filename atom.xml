    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>1 year and 22 days ago, or 387 days ago, on March 25th, 2016, I started a project to bring Home Assistant to the iPhone.</p>

<p>I thought the existing notification and location solutions were lacking in one way or another and had wanted for <em>years</em> to have a project I could call my own which would allow me to learn iOS development. What better way then implementing an extremely complex application like Home Assistant?</p>

<p>I started with a lot of steam. I remember cranking out the initial work that night and showing Paulus who was astounded at how fast the UI was coming together.</p>

<p>Little would I know how many problems I would create and uncover throughout the process. Writing a mobile app for a project that moves as fast as Home Assistant is… tricky, to say the least. In the time since I started writing the app, Home Assistant had 90 releases. I started writing the day before 0.16 was released. Now we are at 0.42.3. Time flies…</p>

<p>I couldn’t have completed the app without help and input from the community. By the end I had 700 beta testers, of which about 500 were very active in testing the app.</p>

<p>I received emails and forum posts almost every day, even when the app would go without an update for weeks and sometimes months at a time as my life got busier and busier.</p>

<p>I wanted this app to be done 9 months ago, at least, but my drive to add more and more features killed that idea. This really taught me the value of the MVP over the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>It may not look the way that I wanted it to initially, with beautiful native UI components, but thats okay. What I really cared about is there. The notification and location engines are some of the most customizable and powerful available in an iOS app if I do say so myself. I made them this way to keep with the spirit of infinite flexibility that is enshrined in Home Assistant.</p>

<p>Just because the app is released doesn’t mean we are at the end of the road. It’s only the beginning. There’s plenty of bugs to fix still, improvements to make, features to add. Beta testing will continue, and if anything, be expanded. I do want to have a native UI someday, but that’s pretty hard with how fast the project moves.</p>

<p>The biggest request I have is for more developers on the project. As many of you know, I have my hands in many different parts of Home Assistant, from governance and organization to managing the forums to writing this app, managing the Homebridge plugin and even sometimes writing code for the actual core codebase! I can’t do it all, and I’m still a new iOS developer who doesn’t know all the best practices.</p>

<p>The app is <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-iOS">open source</a>, has been for the last few months when I first prepared to submit it to Apple for review. I invite Swift developers to come and join me in building it. Trust me, there’s tons to do.</p>

<p><strong>1 year and 22 days ago, on March 25th, 2016 I began work on Home Assistant for iOS.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Today, April 16th, 2017, I am <em>extremely</em> excited to announce that Home Assistant for iOS has been approved by Apple and is now available to download for <del>a monthly subscription starting at $9.99</del> free! (had to get a joke in here somewhere!) on the iOS App Store in every country.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/home-assistant-open-source-home-automation/id1099568401?mt=8" style="display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(//linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/assets/shared/badges/en-us/appstore-lrg.svg) no-repeat;width:135px;height:40px;background-size:contain;"></a></p>

<p><em>Please note, you must have Home Assistant 0.42.4 or later installed for the app to function properly.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for everything so far, I’m looking forward to the road that lies ahead for Home Assistant on iOS!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/#added_in_current_version/"><img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-04-0.42/social.png" style="border: 0;box-shadow: none;" /></a></p>

<p>It’s time for Home Assistant 0.42. This release has been focused on refining the system and fixing a lot of bugs. We have also upgraded to the latest version of our HTTP library which should give us a significant boost serving files and API.</p>

<p>On our social media front, we have crossed the 1000 likes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/homeassistantio">our Facebook page</a>! Also on the social media front, the YouTube channel diyAutomate has been putting out a lot of great getting started videos about Home Assistant, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/diyautomate">go check them out!</a></p>

<p>Also want to take a moment to thank Austin Andrews aka <a href="https://github.com/templarian">Templarian</a> for his <a href="https://materialdesignicons.com/">Material Design Icons</a>. He is part of what makes Home Assistant so beautiful 🤗.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We were incorrectly treating groups named <code class="highlighter-rouge">default_view</code> as default views. Make sure you set <code class="highlighter-rouge">view: true</code> in the config for these groups. <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/pull/251">#251 (frontend)</a></li>
  <li>The last release introduced a revamped LIFX platform. We only realised after deploy that this version does not work on Windows. We have added the old LIFX implementation back as <code class="highlighter-rouge">lifx_legacy</code>.</li>
  <li>We added indexes to the database to speed up the history view. Initial boot can take a couple of minutes. Do not shut down while migration is occurring. <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6688">#6688</a></li>
  <li>Z-Wave cover workaround has been removed. Use device config instead. <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6832">#6832</a></li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>If you set an initial state for an automation, input_boolean, input_slider or input_select it will overrule over the previous state. <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6924">#6911</a></li>
  <li>Z-Wave rename node service parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">entity_id</code> has been replaced with <code class="highlighter-rouge">node_id</code> to align parameters <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6938">#6938</a></li>
  <li>Automations are now initialized when Home Assistant finishes starting up. This means that it is deprecated to listen for event <code class="highlighter-rouge">homeassistant_start</code>. Instead, use the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">homeassistant</code> automation platform. <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6936">#6936</a></li>

    <updated>2017-04-01T06:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/04/01/thomas-krenn-award</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may already know from our social media channels and the release blog post for 0.41: We are now an award-winning Open source project. The jury of the <a href="https://www.thomas-krenn.com/de/tkmag/allgemein/zammad-home-assistant-und-freifunk-das-sind-die-gewinner-des-thomas-krenn-awards-2017/">Thomas-Krenn-Award</a> put us on the 2nd place. This is an awesome achievment for an independent community project.</p>

<p>I would like to thanks all contributors. Your endless effort made this possible.</p>

<p><img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-04-award/award.jpg" style="border: 0;box-shadow: none;" /></p>

<p>The prize beside the very nice trophy contains hardware and we want to give that hardware partically away. We won four <a href="https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/products/low-energy-systems/les-v2.html">Low Energy Server v2 (LES)</a> units with an Intel Celeron N2930, 8 GB of RAM, and a mSATA of 128 GB (one unit with 64 GB). We were thinking about to keep one of those units in Europe and one in North America for testing and to use during workshops and events. But the other two will go to interested parties.</p>

<p>As a raffle would be to easy, we make a contest out of it. This means that we are looking for your application. Of course, we would like to see those systems goes to active or future developers who can justify their need for one of the systems to run CI, UI tests, public accessible Home Assistant demo instances, etc. At the other hand we would like to keep it open, to see with what people are coming up. Please participate as well if you are planning to automate the public school of your kids with 1000 switches or light, need a server to run it, and want to provide regular feedback about the user experience.</p>

<p>Create an entry in our <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/contest-2017">Forum</a>. Be creative and use your imagination.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="the-details" href="#the-details"></a> The details</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Jury: The Home Assistant community</li>
  <li>Dead line: April, 23 2017 - 23.59 UTC</li>
  <li>Voting period: April, 24th till April, 30 2017 - 23.59 UTC</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision of the jury will be final. If there will be a dispute then the Top-5 commiter of the Home Assistant organisation on Github will decide. Also, we reserve us the right to ban applications if we suspect cheating or unfair methods. Updates will be available in the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/contest-2017">Forum</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/home_assistant">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you may have to pay the fee for customs handling and the import duty by yourself. The plan is to ship the hardware from Germany. If you are located in a country with import/export regulations, we may not be able to ship the hardware to you.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[HTTP to MQTT bridge]]></title>
    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/28/http-to-mqtt-bridge/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-28T06:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/28/http-to-mqtt-bridge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The idea of creating <a href="https://github.com/petkov/http_to_mqtt">HTTP to MQTT bridge</a> appeared when I was trying to integrate Google Assistant with my Home Assistant after watching <a href="https://youtu.be/087tQ7Ly7f4?t=265">BRUH Automation</a> video. Right now there is no MQTT service available in <a href="https://ifttt.com/about">IFTTT</a>. Existing integration solution uses <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks">Maker Webhooks</a> which requires that your Home Assistant instance is publically accessible, which I think brings some security concerns or simply not always possible to set up.</p>

<p>The HTTP to MQTT bridge should fill that gap. The idea is to receive messages using HTTP requests and transfer them to your MQTT broker, which can be contacted by Home Assistant. The HTTP to MQTT bridge is written using Node.js with <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> for the server part and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt">MQTT.js</a> for the client.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The app could be hosted on any Node.js hosting. I prefer <a href="https://www.heroku.com/home">Heroku: Cloud Application Platform</a> for its simplicity.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="bringing-pieces-together" href="#bringing-pieces-together"></a> Bringing pieces together</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Configure the Home Assistant <a href="https://home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#mqtt-trigger">MQTT trigger</a>.</li>
  <li>Configure <a href="https://www.cloudmqtt.com/">CloudMQTT</a>. Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaWdvVVYU3A">video tutorial</a> for details.</li>
  <li><a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/petkov/http_to_mqtt"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy" /></a> HTTP to MQTT bridge app.</li>
  <li>Add the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#setting-up-config-vars-for-a-deployed-application">Configuration Variables</a> to your Heroku app mentioned here.
    <ul>
      <li>AUTH_KEY: Can be any string, eg. <code class="highlighter-rouge">912ec803b2ce49e4a541068d495ab570</code>.</li>
      <li>MQTT_HOST: The host of your MQTT broker, eg. mqtts://k99.cloudmqtt.com:21234.</li>
      <li>MQTT_USER: MQTT username</li>
      <li>MQTT_PASS: MQTT password</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create an IFTTT applet the same way as described in <a href="https://youtu.be/087tQ7Ly7f4?t=265">BRUH Automation</a> video.</li>
  <li>Configure <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks">Maker Webhooks</a> service with below parameters.
    <ul>
      <li>URL: <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://&lt;app_name&gt;.herokuapp.com/post/</code></li>
      <li>Method: <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST</code></li>
      <li>Content Type: <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/json</code></li>
      <li>Body: <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="nt">"topic"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"&lt;mqtt_topic&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">"message"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"&lt;mqtt_message&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nt">"key"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"&lt;AUTH_KEY&gt;"</span><span class="p">}</span></code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="subscribe-to-latest-version" href="#subscribe-to-latest-version"></a> Subscribe to latest version</h3>

<p>Additionally you can make Heroku to update the HTTP to MQTT bridge app to the latest available version from the GitHub repository automatically. To do this follow the instruction on the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys">Heroku help page</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="improve-response-time" href="#improve-response-time"></a> Improve response time</h3>

<p>After 30 minutes of inactivity Heroku will put your app into sleep mode. This will result in ~10 seconds response time. To prevent Heroku from putting your app into sleep mode, ping it every 10 minutes. You can do that by sending regular HTTP GET request to http://your_app/keep_alive/. But be careful. Heroku free quota is 550 hours per month. Without sleeping your app will be allowed to run only 22 days a month. Additionally the <code class="highlighter-rouge">keep_alive</code> method will send a simple MQTT message to prevent the broker from sleeping as well. The topic and message can be configured using Heroku environment variables <code class="highlighter-rouge">KEEP_ALIVE_TOPIC</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">KEEP_ALIVE_MESSAGE</code> and both are set to “keep_alive” by default.</p>

<p>You can even configure Home Assistant to ping HTTP to MQTT bridge every 10 minutes during daytime. Below is an example of how to do that:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">rest_command</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">http_to_mqtt_keep_alive</span><span class="pi">:</span>

    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/25/todo-volumio-workday</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to 0.41. There was a lot going on in the last two weeks. Not only from the code side but also from the social one of Home Assistant. <a href="https://github.com/balloob">Paulus</a> did an <a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/23/opensourcecraft-interview-with-founder-paulus-schoutsen/">interview</a> with <a href="http://codepop.com/open-sourcecraft">OpenSourceCraft</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fabaff">Fabian</a> did a <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-assets/tree/master/german/2017-clt-workshop">workshop</a> at the <a href="https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2017/en/">Chemnitzer Linux Tage</a>, and we are now an award-winning Open source project (I will cover that in a separate blog post).</p>

<h2>Plex</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JesseWebDotCom">@JesseWebDotCom</a> made massive changes to the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.plex/">Plex</a> media player platform. From better metadata support over new configuration options to improved controls and non-controllable clients.</p>

<h2>Component overview</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/">Components</a> overview is now powered by search/filtering feature. This will make it faster to get the component/platform you are looking for more quickly. Thanks again, <a href="https://github.com/bdurrer">@bdurrer</a> for this.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<p>The new format of the changelog which was introduced with 0.40 will provide a link to the related pull request. We are not covering everything in our release notes but we think that this addition will make it easier to find details about the change.</p>

<h2>New platforms/components</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Support for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/climate.tado/">Tado</a> climate devices (<a href="https://github.com/wmalgadey">@wmalgadey</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://home-assistant.io//components/media_player.volumio/">Volumio</a> media player added (<a href="https://github.com/jslove">@jslove</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.workday/">Workday</a> sensor (<a href="https://github.com/BastianPoe">@BastianPoe</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.kodi/">Kodi notifier</a> platform was migrated to async and the configuration synced with the Kodi media player platform (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6497">#6497</a>).</li>
  <li>For the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.mpd/">Music Player Daemon</a> (MPD) platform was <code class="highlighter-rouge">location</code> replaced with <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6553">#6553</a>).</li>
  <li>Event decorators were removed (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6634">#6634</a>).</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.emby/">Emby mediaplayer</a> platform was changed to avoid name clashes (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6664">#6664</a>).</li>
  <li>In a lot of places were the power and energy units update. This change mostly affects the <code class="highlighter-rouge">switch</code> platforms (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6212">#6212</a>).</li>
  <li>If set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">auto</code> then the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/">MQTT</a> implementation will use the bundled certificates automatically (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6707">#6707</a>).</li>
  <li>Autodiscovery of <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/android_ip_webcam/">Android IP Webcam</a> was removed (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/6528">#6528</a>).</li>
  <li>The frontend is now using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/">Shadow DOM</a> and this could break your custom panels (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/issues/228">#228</a>).</li>
</ul>

    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/23/opensourcecraft-interview-with-founder-paulus-schoutsen</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month Gregg Pollack from <a href="http://codepop.com/open-sourcecraft">OpenSourceCraft</a> visited me in San Diego to talk about Home Assistant. We talked about the community and how all these awesome people make Home Assistant possible. The main interview is embedded below but make sure to check out the <a href="http://codepop.com/open-sourcecraft/episodes/paulus-schoutsen/">full article including extra video material</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/22/broken-dependencies/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-22T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/22/broken-dependencies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL; DR: We have just released version 0.40.2 that includes a fix related to the installation of dependencies.</p>

<p>Some users in the last few days have been reporting that their Home Assistant installation fails to start with an error in the http component:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ImportError: No module named 'aiohttp.file_sender'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The problem is that Home Assistant did not handle the case where a dependency would want to install a core dependency of Home Assistant that is newer than what Home Assistant works with. For now, we have identified the following two components that can cause this issue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AppleTV (0.38+)</li>
  <li>Android IP Webcam (0.40+)</li>
</ul>

<p>This issue has been resolved by 0.40.2. If you are on an impacted version and cannot upgrade to the latest version just yet, a temporary workaround will be to remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;config dir&gt;/deps</code> directory and stop using the above mentioned integrations. In the case of AppleTV, you will also have to disable the discovery component to prevent it from being auto-detected.</p>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/11/repurpose-any-android-phone-as-ip-camera/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-11T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/11/repurpose-any-android-phone-as-ip-camera</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/#added_in_current_version/"><img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-03-0.40/social.png" style="border: 0;box-shadow: none;" /></a></p>

<p>It’s time for version 0.40 already! For this version, the main focus was on performance and bug fixes. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a> for driving this effort. Startup is now super fast. We have also continued with adding warnings for components and platforms that are slowing down Home Assistant.</p>

<p>Some people have interpreted our recent added warnings as if 0.39 introduced the issues that caused the warning. This is not the case, the platforms and components have been misbehaving for a while but now we are adding warnings so we are able to track down the culprits.</p>

<p>Before we continue talking about all the improvements in this release I want to take a moment to thank a few people from the Home Assistant community that are fundamental to the success of Home Assistant. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dale3h">@dale3h</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CCOSTAN">@CCOSTAN</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skalavala">@skalavala</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rrubin0">@rrubin0</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brahmafear">@brahmafear</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bassclarinetl2">@bassclarinetl2</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/torn8o">@torn8o</a>! These are all people that hang out in our <a href="https://gitter.im/home-assistant/home-assistant">main chat channel</a> and help new users get started and help existing users when running into trouble. Home Assistant would not be there without all the effort you put in! 🙇</p>

<p>And that our community kicks ass is also shown in the numbers. We have already raised together over $700 for the <a href="https://www.eff.org">EFF</a> via the sale of <a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/22/home-assistant-tshirts-have-arrived/">our t-shirts</a>! All of you rock! Another number worth mentioning is that this release brings us passed 600 integrations for Home Assistant. All of you rock, again!</p>

<h2>Z-Wave is now threadsafe</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/andrey-git">@andrey-git</a> has spend a lot of time to make Z-Wave perform better. It should no longer cause Home Assistant to run slower or raise warnings about the timer getting out of sync.</p>

<h2>Update on the MQTT Out of Memory errors in 0.39</h2>

<p>MQTT started causing “Out of Memory” errors for some people on a Raspberry Pi. We have been able to track this down to Raspberry Pis that are using an older firmware. If you are experiencing this issue, please <a href="https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update#installing">upgrade your firmware using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rpi-update</code></a>.</p>

<h2>Turn any Android phone into an IP Camera</h2>

<p>With the new support for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/android_ip_webcam/">IP Webcam</a> added by <a href="https://github.com/robbiet480">@robbiet480</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a> you are now able to re-purpose any Android phone to become a multifunctional IP webcam. Some of the cool things that you can do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrate the Android device camera</li>
  <li>Binary sensor when motion is detected</li>
  <li>Sensors to expose the device sensors, including pressure, sound, battery, light</li>
  <li>Control device features like the GPS, night vision and camera flash</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Highlights</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Support added for Austrian weather using Zamg weather data (<a href="https://github.com/Zac-HD">@Zac-HD</a>)</li>
  <li>Ring.com video doorbell integration added (<a href="https://github.com/tchellomello">@tchellomello</a>)</li>
  <li>Blink Home Security Camera support added (<a href="https://github.com/fronzbot">@fronzbot</a>)</li>
  <li>AppleTV has been converted to push data to Home Assistant instead of us having to poll (<a href="https://github.com/postlund">@postlund</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Vera entity ids have changed. This is a one time change to migrate to a model that will prevent future conflicts.</li>
  <li>The Twilio notify platforms now have to be configured via the twilio component.</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">twilio</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">account_sid</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">abc"</span>
  <span class="s">auth_token</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">xyz"</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>If you are using async custom components, the passed in <code class="highlighter-rouge">async_add_devices</code> method is now a callback instead of a coroutine function.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/25/config-panel-and-state-restoration/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-25T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/25/config-panel-and-state-restoration</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s time for 0.39 and this release has some amazing new features!</p>

<p><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/#added_in_current_version/"><img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-02-0.39/social.png" style="border: 0;box-shadow: none;" /></a></p>

<h2>T-Shirts</h2>

<p>First off, in case you haven’t seen it yet: <a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/22/home-assistant-tshirts-have-arrived/">we have t-shirts</a> now and they are beautiful. All proceeds from the shirts will be donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The first three days all of you have already raised $400! Still waiting for Teespring to get back to me so stay tuned for the EU store.</p>

<h2>Configuration panel</h2>

<p>Yep, you read that right. We have a configuration panel. It’s just the first of many small steps. Putting in a foundation is important and gives us something to iterate on.</p>

<p>To start, we have three simple configuration panels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Core: allows you to validate config, reload core/group/automation config and restart/stop Home Assistant</li>
  <li>Group: allows you to rename groups, change type between group/view and reorder entities.</li>
  <li>Z-Wave: allows you to set device specific configuration settings</li>
</ul>

<p class="img">
  <img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-02-0.39/config.png" />
  Screenshot of our new configuration panel.
</p>

<p>As a security measure, the configuration panel will need to be activated in the config file to be activated. This can be done by adding the following to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">configuration.yaml</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">config</span><span class="pi">:</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using our configuration panels will require you to structure your groups and Z-Wave device config according to how the configuration panel expects it. This is on purpose as it we will not be aiming to build a system that supports both our extended set of configuration extend hooks and our configuration panels. It’s one or the other.</p>

<p>To activate them in your config, create empty files <code class="highlighter-rouge">groups.yaml</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">zwave_device_config.yaml</code> in your config dir and add the following entries to your config:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">group</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="kt">!include</span> <span class="s">groups.yaml</span>

<span class="s">zwave</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">device_config</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="kt">!include</span> <span class="s">zwave_device_config.yaml</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><em>Note that this is the first release. Things will be missing, things might be broken.</em></p>

<h2>Reorganized documentation</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/fabaff">Fabian</a> we have a great re-organized documentation. Is it perfect yet? No. But we are getting close. We put a lot of focus on making sure the Raspberry Pi is the main focus of our getting started. The other instructions are still available, just not as part of the main getting started.</p>

<h2>State restoration</h2>

<p>Ever have some input components or integrations and get annoyed with the fact that their state is lost after a restart? Don’t worry any longer. <a href="https://github.com/kellerza">Johann</a> has added the foundation for state restoration to Home Assistant. For the initial release support has been added to to <code class="highlighter-rouge">input_select</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">input_boolean</code> components. We will be adding this to more integrations in the future.</p>

<h2>Breaking changes to customize and Z-Wave “customize”</h2>

<p>A couple of releases ago we introduced a new way of doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">customize</code>. It became a list that allowed different ways of matching the config to the entity.</p>

<p>We realized that this was leading into a rabbit hole that we had to get out off. Besides making it unnecessarily complicated it also blocked the road to config panels. And who doesn’t like config panels?</p>

<p>So starting this release, we had to make some breaking changes to right the wrong. We will be releasing an online tool to help you convert your config to the new format later today.</p>

<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/balloob/d2e56q6f/74/"><strong>Update: the online tool can be found here.</strong></a></p>

<h4>Customize has been reverted to it’s original config</h4>

<p>The old customize is back. The options to match by domain or using glob have been moved to it’s own options. It will now look like this:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">homeassistant</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">customize</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s">light.kitchen</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">hidden</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">true</span>
  <span class="s">customize_domain</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s">light</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">icon</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">mdi:home</span>
  <span class="s">customize_glob</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">light.kitchen_*"</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">icon</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">mid:description</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Z-Wave customize is now device config</h4>

<p>Ever wondered why the Z-Wave customize was called customize? Yeah, so did we. So when migrating this to the new config format, we decided to upgrade the name too:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">zwave</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">device_config</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s">light.kitchen</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">ignored</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">true</span>
  <span class="s">device_config_domain</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s">light</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">polling_intensity</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">2</span>
  <span class="s">device_config_glob</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">light.kitchen_*"</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="s">polling_intensity</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">0</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Speed improvements</h2>

<p>And a final shout out to <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">Pascal</a>. He keeps improving the performance of components and platforms all over Home Assistant.</p>

  Cool dude with beard and tattoo wearing <a href="https://teespring.com/home-assistant-shirt">the new blue Home Assistant shirt</a>.
</p>

<p>What time is it? Yep, t-shirt time. Today we’re launching the first two Home Assistant designs. We have a blue t-shirt (<a href="https://teespring.com/hass-blue-shirt-eu-2">🇪🇺 EU</a> – <a href="https://teespring.com/home-assistant-shirt">🇺🇸 US</a>) as pictured above and a design for on black/gray shirts (<a href="https://teespring.com/hass-shirt-black-eu-2">🇪🇺 EU</a> – <a href="https://teespring.com/hass-shirt-black">🇺🇸 US</a>) as pictured below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://teespring.com/stores/home-assistant-us-store">Visit the 🇺🇸 US store</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://teespring.com/stores/home-assistant-eu-store">Visit the 🇪🇺 EU store</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org"><img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/supported_brands/eff.png" style="width: 150px; float: right; box-shadow: none; border: 0; margin-left: 15px;" /></a></p>

<p>And because we love the internet and all the things that it has brought us, <strong>we will start with having 100% of the profit from the sales be donated to the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></strong>. If you buy a shirt you will hit two birds with one stone (figuratively): you get to wear a kick-ass Home Assistant t-shirt and you help fund defending civil liberties in the digital world.</p>

<p>The EFF is a nonprofit organization that aims to protect the rights of technology users. You might however be more familiar with one of their projects: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let’s Encrypt</a>. <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues">Read more about what the EFF does.</a></p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for? Get yourself a shirt! <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/home-assistant-eu-store">🇪🇺 EU store</a> – <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/home-assistant-us-store">🇺🇸 US store</a></p>

</p>

<p>We are using <a href="https://teespring.com">Teespring.com</a> to manage all the sales, production and distribution of the shirts and they will also donate our profits to the EFF. It’s also how we got all these amazing stockphotos. Some extra things to note about our teespring shop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teespring shows that there is a number of days left until the end of the campaign for the shirts. Don’t worry about that, it should automatically relaunch.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/11/alert-appletv-mqtt-yeelight/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-11T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/11/alert-appletv-mqtt-yeelight</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another Saturday, another release!</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="core-updates" href="#core-updates"></a> Core updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a>, all the core components are now written asynchronously. All entity components are now migrated from synchronously to asynchronously code!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now when you restart Home Assistant using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">homeassistant.restart</code> service, your configuration is checked. If it appears to be invalid the restart will fail.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="rewritten-frontend" href="#rewritten-frontend"></a> Rewritten frontend</h3>
<p>The frontend has been completely been rewritten, optimizing for speed and lost connection recovery. Even on the slowest phones it should fly now. The frontend also now uses the new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/websocket_api/">WebSockets API</a> instead of the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/server_sent_events/">EventStream API</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="custom-state-card-ui" href="#custom-state-card-ui"></a> Custom state card UI</h3>
<p>A nice new feature is the possibility to create <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/frontend_creating_custom_ui/">custom state cards</a> in the frontend. Go ahead and write your own state card for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/cookbook/custom_ui_by_andrey-git">lights</a>, sensors, locks, etc.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="mqtt-discovery" href="#mqtt-discovery"></a> MQTT discovery</h3>
<p>MQTT now has <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/mqtt/#discovery">discovery</a> support which is different than our <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/discovery/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">discovery</code></a> component. Similar to the HTTP sensor and HTTP binary sensor, MQTT discovery removes the need for configuration by allowing devices to make their presence known to Home Assistant.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="alert-component" href="#alert-component"></a> Alert component</h3>
<p>If you left your front door open, then the new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/alert/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">alert</code></a> component can be used to remind you of this by sending you repeating notifications at a given interval.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="yeelight" href="#yeelight"></a> Yeelight</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/light.yeelight/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">yeelight</code></a> component has been ported to use a more stable and feature-complete <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/python-yeelight">python-yeelight</a> backend, and supports now both white and RGB bulbs. The component also supports transitions and can be configured to save the settings to the bulb on changes. The users currently using custom components for Yeelight are encouraged to move back to use the included version and report any problems with it to our <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="apple-tv" href="#apple-tv"></a> Apple TV</h3>
<p><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.apple_tv/">Apple TV</a> is now a supported <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">media_player</code></a>! It has support for just about every media player function, including a realtime display of playback status and artwork.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The support for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.webostv/">LG webOS Smart TVs</a> was improved. This requires you to move <code class="highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.pylgtv</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">$HASS_CONFIG_DIR/webostv.conf</code> or Home Assistant will need to be paired with the TV again.</li>
  <li>Image processing events have been renamed: <code class="highlighter-rouge">identify_face</code> has become <code class="highlighter-rouge">image_processing.detect_face</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">found_plate</code> has become <code class="highlighter-rouge">image_processing.found_plate</code></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.ffmpeg/">FFmpeg binary sensor</a> change the platform name from <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg_noise</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg_motion</code>. Also all FFmpeg-related services are moved from a platform implementation to a the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/ffmpeg/">FFmpeg components</a> and were rename from <code class="highlighter-rouge">binary_sensor.ffmpeg_xy</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg.xy</code>.</li>
  <li>The frontend core changes have caused all custom panels to break. Docs have not been updated yet. The gist is that you have to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">this.hass.entities</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">this.hass.callService</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">this.hass.callApi</code>.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/04/hassbian-toybox/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-04T09:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/04/hassbian-toybox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I’m happy to announce a new release of the our Raspberry Pi image, <strong>HASSbian 1.1 - The Toy-box.</strong><br />
Why Toy-box you wonder? Because it encompass the changes pretty well.</p>

<p>Changes from previous image are big and small but lets start with the interesting things.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="hassbian-scripts" href="#hassbian-scripts"></a> Hassbian-scripts</h3>
<p>A set of script written to add extra functionality to your Raspberry Pi installation. 
This scripts are run as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pi</code> user and installs a set of tools or packages.
Currently includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install Libcec. Adds local <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/hdmi_cec/">HDMI CEC support</a>.</li>
  <li>Install Mossquitto. Installs the latest Mosquitto package and client tools from the Mosquitto projects official repository. Now includes websocket support.</li>
  <li>Install OpenZWave. Installs OpenZWave and prepares for using a USB or GPIO ZWave controller.</li>
  <li>Install Samba. Installs the Samba packages and shares your configuration over smb to be available to edit on any computer without the need for separate file transfer software. This share is unsecured and it’s usage is not recommended if your installation is publicly available.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these scripts are available in the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home/pi/hassbian-scripts/</code>. This directory is actually a cloned git repository that’s cloned on first boot and can be updated to the latest release with ease after.
To update the hassbian-scripts directory execute the following command as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pi</code> user.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>hassbian-scripts
<span class="gp">$ </span>git pull
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To use any of the hassbian-scripts, execute the following command as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pi</code> user. Here we use the libcec script as an example.</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>sudo ./hassbian-scripts/install_libcec.sh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>For more information about these scripts have a look a the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/hassbian-scripts">hassbian-scripts repository</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="spring-cleaning" href="#spring-cleaning"></a> Spring cleaning</h3>
<p>With this image there also quite a bit of cleaning of the base system and the script that generates our Raspberry Pi image.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update pi-gen. Our build script has been upgraded to follow the Raspbian image closer. This image is basically a Raspbian lite image with Home Assistant, dependencies and a small set of changes to the base system.</li>
  <li>Removed Mosquitto. Not as bad as it sounds since it’s installation has been move to one of our new hassbian-scripts.</li>
  <li>Added rng-tools. Let’s your HASSbian installation use the hardware support in the Raspberry Pi for entropy generation.</li>
  <li>Added avahi-daemon package. Your Raspberry Pi should now be available at <a href="hassbian.local">hassbian.local</a>.</li>
  <li>Added htop. User friendly interactive process monitor.</li>
  <li>Added tmux. A great terminal multiplexer that makes working with the command line over ssh easier.</li>
  <li>Added the <code class="highlighter-rouge">homeassistant</code> user to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dialout</code> group. Simplifies use of hardware such as ZWave USB controllers that requires this permission.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="on-the-horizon" href="#on-the-horizon"></a> On the horizon</h3>
<p>There’s of course more on the horizon and there’s even more plans and wishes for how this image will function in the future.
On the close horizon from <a href="https://github.com/Landrash">@Landrash</a> there a few more script in the works and for tellstick, emulated_hue and for controlling Home Assistant.</p>

<p>To follow discussions about the development of the HASSbian image or to contribute join the <a href="https://gitter.im/home-assistant/hassbian">HASSbian gitter chat</a>.</p>

<p>To get started with the new image, check out the installation instructions in the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/installation-raspberry-pi-image/">getting started section</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/03/babyphone/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-03T23:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/02/03/babyphone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the hardest part of being a parent is keeping a constant eye on the baby to make sure that baby is doing well. Thus, it is not surprising that baby monitors are one of the fastest growing baby product category. However, many of the baby monitors available on the market are rather dumb and expect the parents to keep looking at the video stream or listen to the audio. This how-to will help you create a smart baby monitor on a budget and integrate it with Home Assitant. Instead of relying on the poor quality baby monitor speakers, we use our existing speakers (eg. Sonos). We can also send notifications (with pictures) to avoid constant monitoring of the feed.</p>

<p>Obviously, you can use the setup as a general purpose surveillance system to monitor noise in the whole house.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3><a class="title-link" name="setup" href="#setup"></a> Setup</h3>

<p>We need an IP camera that can capture sound in the baby’s room. It is also possible to use a Raspberry Pi with a microphone and send the audio to Home Assistant with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:1,0 -vn -f rtp rtp://236.0.0.1:2000</code> over multicast. We can set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> option on the Home Assistant side to <code class="highlighter-rouge">rtp://236.0.0.1:2000</code> in same network.</p>

<p>Next, we attach a FFmpeg noise binary sensor to our IP camera. The sensor has an output <code class="highlighter-rouge">option</code> that allows us to send the output to an <a href="http://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> server for playing over speakers integrated with Home Assistant (eg. Sonos). We can use the binary sensor in our automation. You can ignore the icecast2 setup if you don’t want to play the audio after the noise sensor trigger.</p>

<p class="note">
We change the platform name for binary sensor in 0.38 from <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg_noise</code>. Also all service going to component and was rename from <code class="highlighter-rouge">binary_sensor.ffmpeg_xy</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg.xy</code>.
</p>

<p>On Raspbian Jessie, you can setup <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/ffmpeg/">FFmpeg</a> and install a <a href="http://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> server using:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>sudo <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main"</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
<span class="gp">$ </span>sudo apt-get update
<span class="gp">$ </span>sudo apt-get -t jessie-backports install ffmpeg
<span class="gp">$ </span>sudo apt-get install icecast2
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We setup a icecast mount point for our babyphone and update <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;mount&gt;
    &lt;mount-name&gt;/babyphone.mp3&lt;/mount-name&gt;
    &lt;stream-name&gt;Babyphone&lt;/stream-name&gt;

    &lt;username&gt;stream_user&lt;/username&gt;
    &lt;password&gt;stream_pw&lt;/password&gt;
&lt;/mount&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now we can add the noise sensor to Home Assistant. We can lower the sensitivity of the sensor (so that you are not inundated with notifications for every cough of the baby) to 2 seconds using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">duration</code> option. The sensor should wait 60 seconds before restoring and it prevent us that a wine break will triggering a new alarm.</p>

<p>We can optimize the audio stream for human voice by using a highpass filter with 300 Hz and a lowpass filter with 2500 Hz. This filters out all non-human sounds such as background noise. We can even add a volume amplifier if the microphone volume is too low (you can remove it from <code class="highlighter-rouge">extra_arguments</code>). For icecast2 we convert the audio stream to mp3 with samplerate of 16000 (which is the minimum for Sonos speakers). We use <code class="highlighter-rouge">peak</code> to set the threshold for noise detection, where 0 dB is very loud and -100 dB is low.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">binary_sensor</span><span class="pi">:</span>

    <span class="s">peak</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">-32</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>We use the option <code class="highlighter-rouge">initial_state</code> to prevent the FFmpeg process from starting with Home Assistant and only start it when needed. We use an <code class="highlighter-rouge">input_boolean</code>  to control the state of FFmpeg services using the following automation.</p>

Beside some organizational changes is this release shipping again cool features and new integrations. Please keep an eye on the “Breaking changes” section because there are also massive improvements for some platforms and components.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="governance" href="#governance"></a> Governance</h3>
<p>As announced, the new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/21/home-assistant-governance/">Governance</a> requires for developers to sign the CLA. <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/code_of_conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/cla/">Contributor License Agreement</a>, and proper <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/license/">Licensing</a> will to protect all involved parties in the Home Assistant eco-system from users and community members to contributors.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="face-recognition-using-the-microsoft-face-api" href="#face-recognition-using-the-microsoft-face-api"></a> Face recognition using the Microsoft Face API</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a> has been on a roll with the image processing integrations. This time it’s the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/microsoft_face/">Microsoft Face API</a>. This means that now it will be possible to train the API with the people you want to recognize and send images from your camera to the API as another source of automation.</p>

<p>Want to play a personalized tune when someone enters the house? It is now possible 😎</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="improved-camera-security" href="#improved-camera-security"></a> Improved camera security</h3>

<p>After a security audit by Stephen O’Conner, he found that our source for randomly generated access tokens for camera feeds were reasonable predictable and could be brute force attacked in 2.5 weeks. A fix has been included in this release that uses the system provided random number generator for maximum randomness and rotates the keys every 10 minutes to reduce the window in which a brute force attack can happen.</p>

<p>Although the old method is not insecure, the new method is a lot more secure. Upgrading to the latest version is encouraged.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="new-customization-options" href="#new-customization-options"></a> New customization options</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/andrey-git">@Andrey-git</a> has added some great new options to the customize functionality. It is now possible to specify customizations as a wildcard for entities or for a specific domain.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="major-wink-and-hdmi-cec-improvements" href="#major-wink-and-hdmi-cec-improvements"></a> Major Wink and HDMI CEC improvements</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/w1ll1am23">@w1ll1am23</a> did an amazing job fixing a ton of bugs and issues with the Wink integration. Biggest improvement is that it now is able to automatically refresh the authentication tokens. This means that if you have your email address and password in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">configuration.yaml</code> file, no <code class="highlighter-rouge">client_id</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">client_secret</code> are needed, and token which was generated with the generator located in the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/wink/">Wink</a> documentation.</p>

<p>The new Wink support will cause renaming of all the binary sensors and will also create new sensors for devices that weren’t previously detected or supported in the older version.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/konikvranik">@konikvranik</a> the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/hdmi_cec/">HDMI CEC</a> integration got a huge update with a lot of improvements. This update should make it easier to work with HDMI CEC and give you more control.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="first-coffee-maker-supported" href="#first-coffee-maker-supported"></a> First Coffee Maker supported</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/stu-gott">@stu-gott</a> has added support for the first coffee maker in Home Assistant: <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.wemo/">Mr. Coffee Smart Optimal Brew</a>. Happy brewing!</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="breaking-changes" href="#breaking-changes"></a> Breaking changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>major</strong> breaking change in the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/emulated_hue/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">emulated_hue</code></a> component means that unless you set <code class="highlighter-rouge">type: alexa</code> before starting up the newer Home Assistant version you will lose all devices that Alexa has discovered and will need to re-add them as well as create new groups.</li>
  <li>The platform of the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.iss/">ISS</a> integration was change to <code class="highlighter-rouge">binary_sensor</code>. Please check the platform documentation.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.roku/">Roku</a> media uses now a new format for the entity IDs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/#image-processing">OpenALPR</a> is no longer a component. It’s now a platform for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/image_processing/">Image processing</a>.</li>
  <li>Due to massive improvements of the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/wink/">Wink</a> integration, the names of your binary sensors will change and new devices can show up.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/mysensors/">MySensors</a> component now requires all persistence file paths to be set if any is set by the user. This is to avoid name conflicts for the paths. If no path is set Home Assistant will set all paths for you.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.sonos/">Sonos</a> service <code class="highlighter-rouge">sonos_group_players</code> was removed. Use now <code class="highlighter-rouge">sonos_join</code> for this function.</li>
  <li>TTS cache have change for the last time. Files use now also a option hash as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">HASH_LANG_OPTIONS_PLATFORM.xxx</code>, replace <em>OPTIONS</em> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code> on exiting platforms.</li>

    <updated>2017-01-21T23:05:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/21/home-assistant-governance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><a class="title-link" name="update-jan-28-2017" href="#update-jan-28-2017"></a> UPDATE JAN 28, 2017</h3>

<p>After feedback from the community we have updated <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/cla/">the CLA</a> and the license that Home Assistant is distributed under. For the CLA, instead of enforcing requirements on the grants and code, we now require contributions to be licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mjg59">Matthew Garrett</a> for his feedback and advice.</p>

<p>Starting with release 0.37, Home Assistant will re-license the current code under <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/license/">the Apache 2.0 license</a>. This is the license that will be used moving forward for all projects under our organization.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Home Assistant project and community has seen enormous growth in the last three years. Many volunteers work tirelessly everyday to give you all the awesomeness that you see today. Much more work is involved than many people realize. Beyond simply coding Home Assistant, volunteers continually maintain related projects, update documentation, post examples, author blog posts, and moderate the forums and chat. This is something that we want to keep safe and functional, even as we grow.</p>

<p>Starting today we are announcing a few initiatives to help protect our users, contributors and community members.</p>

<!--more-->
<h2><a class="title-link" name="code-of-conduct" href="#code-of-conduct"></a> Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>More people are getting to know and love Home Assistant every day and our community keeps growing. Our community consists of people from all over the world with different backgrounds and we want Home Assistant to be a place where everyone can feel at home. To help with this we’re introducing a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct describes what type of behavior is unacceptable, how we will enforce it and where to report incidents.</p>

<p>Moving forward this Code of Conduct will be active for all projects within the Home Assistant organisation.</p>

<p><a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/code_of_conduct/">Read the Code of Conduct</a></p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="contributor-license-agreement" href="#contributor-license-agreement"></a> Contributor License Agreement</h2>

<p>Moving forward we will also require that all contributors to any project have electronically signed our <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/cla/">contributor license agreement (CLA)</a>. <del>We have adopted the CLA that GitHub uses for their projects</del> (see update at the top). Currently we have no plans to retroactively require a CLA for previous contributions, only those going forward.</p>

<p>Until a signed CLA is on file your pull request will not be reviewed or accepted. When you open a new pull request, if you do not have a CLA on file, our helpful bot will walk you through the steps to complete the process.</p>

<p><strong>We intend to require an electronically signed contributor licensing agreement for all contributors beginning with our next release (0.37), currently scheduled for release on Saturday, January 28th, 2017 (one week from today).</strong> The CLA is being added to all repositories today.</p>

<p>A CLA is difficult to describe but GitHub did an excellent job so this next section is taken from <a href="https://cla.github.com/">https://cla.github.com</a>:</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="what-is-a-contributor-license-agreement" href="#what-is-a-contributor-license-agreement"></a> What is a Contributor License Agreement?</h3>

<p>A Contributor License Agreement, known as a CLA, asks contributors to confirm that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Anyone can use your contributions anywhere, for free, forever.</li>
  <li>Your contributions do not infringe on anyone else’s rights.</li>
</ol>

<p>The GitHub CLA helps ensure the smooth operation and usability of the open source projects that we maintain.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="why-is-a-cla-necessary" href="#why-is-a-cla-necessary"></a> Why is a CLA necessary?</h3>

<p>It depends on the jurisdiction, but in the United States, contributions are owned by the author or their employer. When the contribution is accepted, the project becomes a bundle of derivative works. The agreement of all contributors are necessary to maintain distribution of the complete project and to any licensing agreement.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="isnt-that-the-purpose-of-an-open-source-license" href="#isnt-that-the-purpose-of-an-open-source-license"></a> Isn’t that the purpose of an open source license?</h3>

<p>Most open source licenses deal with use of the original code, and don’t refer to contributions, or derivatives of the original.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="how-does-a-cla-protect-a-project" href="#how-does-a-cla-protect-a-project"></a> How does a CLA protect a project?</h3>

<p>If the owner of a contribution decides that they don’t want the contribution to be part of the project or in any given distribution, the law is on their side. The project, contributors, and users may be subject to legal action. This may require payment of damages and could prevent further usage or contributions until the matter is resolved.</p>

<p>Even when there is no legal pursuit, too much ambiguity can jeopardize or doom a project by preventing those that can’t risk legal action from getting involved.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="why-does-it-seem-like-only-corporate-projects-have-a-cla" href="#why-does-it-seem-like-only-corporate-projects-have-a-cla"></a> Why does it seem like only “corporate” projects have a CLA?</h3>

<p>There are many projects without corporate ownership that use a CLA or even a copyright assignment: jQuery and Eclipse, for example. However, it is true that projects with financial backing tend to be at a higher risk of becoming a target, so they may have a lower tolerance for legal ambiguity.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="security-requirements" href="#security-requirements"></a> Security requirements</h2>

<p>With more collaborators involved with Home Assistant we are also exposing ourselves to more risk as more people have write access. As such we taking the following steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>As of November 3rd, 2016, all collaborators have been required to have 2 factor authentication (2FA) enabled on their GitHub account.</li>
  <li>Going forward, we will do an audit from time to time and strip collaborators from write access if they haven’t contributed for a while. This is in no sense meant to boot people, and you are absolutely eligible to get it back in the future when you wish start contributing again.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="licensing" href="#licensing"></a> Licensing</h2>

<p>We will now ensure that a <code class="highlighter-rouge">LICENSE.md</code> file exists in all projects under the Home Assistant organization and is an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved open source license</a> or a <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="code-license" href="#code-license"></a> Code License</h3>

<p>The chosen license for all code projects under the Home Assistant organization is <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/license/">the Apache 2.0 license</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="documentation-license" href="#documentation-license"></a> Documentation License</h3>

<p>All content on home-assistant.io and all other documentation/asset projects under the Home Assistant organization will be licensed under the Creative Commons License, specifically the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a> license.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="crediting-contributors" href="#crediting-contributors"></a> Crediting contributors</h2>

<p>We have now mostly automated updating the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/credits/">Credits</a> page so that contributors get their attribution more quickly.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="in-closing" href="#in-closing"></a> In closing</h2>

<p>We hope you understand that our desire with these changes is only to help protect the amazing community that has been built around Home Assistant. If you have any questions, please contact us via email, Twitter or Gitter.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s week 3 of 2017 and great things did already happen. This is just a little recap.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <a href="https://ossmetrics.com/leaderboard">OSS Metrics leaderboard</a> we are on place 30. Within three months we moved from our starting place which was 66 in September 2016 up to the current one.</li>
  <li>We were listed on <a href="https://github.com/trending/python">Github Trending</a>. Also, was <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> mentioned as trending developer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>’s talk at the OpenIoT Summit 2016 was rated as one of the <a href="http://technewsdir.com/top-5-videos-from-embedded-linux-conference-and-openiot-summit-2016">Top 5 videos</a> of the conference.</li>
  <li>We now ship over <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/#all/">500</a> components and platforms.</li>
  <li>We processed over 3500 Pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant">main repository</a> so far.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may ask yourself why this is amazing. It’s amazing because we are a community-only project driven by volunteers there is no financial support, no company in the background, and no paid developers who are working on Home Assistant. Here is another “Thank you” because you are the driving force behind Home Assistant.</p>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/14/iss-usps-images-packages/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-14T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/14/iss-usps-images-packages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to 2017 and 0.36. We are proud to announce the first release for this year. While we are still migrating parts to async but 0.36 is focusing on new features and a lot of bug fixes.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="packages" href="#packages"></a> Packages</h3>
<p><a href="https://home-assistant.io/topics/packages/">Packages</a> are providing a new way to organize different component’s configuration parts together. With packages we offer the option to include different components or parts of configuration using any of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">!include</code> directives.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="influxdb-export" href="#influxdb-export"></a> InfluxDB export</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> component was causing problems in a wide variety of use cases. <a href="https://github.com/titilambert">@titilambert</a> improved our InfluxDB exporter feature. It might be that you need to run the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/#migration-script/">migration script</a> to update your InfluxDB database.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>hass --script influxdb_migrator <span class="se">\</span>
    -H IP_INFLUXDB_HOST -u INFLUXDB_USERNAME -p INFLUXDB_PASSWORD <span class="se">\</span>
    -d INFLUXDB_DB_NAME
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="international-space-station-iss" href="#international-space-station-iss"></a> International Space Station (ISS)</h3>
<p>No, unfortunately we are not going to space. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">iss</code> sensor is tracking the position of the International Space Station and gives you some details.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="insteon-local" href="#insteon-local"></a> Insteon local</h3>
<p>The support for Insteon was removed due to issues a while ago. With the <code class="highlighter-rouge">insteon_local</code> component support for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/insteon_local/">Insteon</a> is back and let one work locally with an Insteon setup.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="image-processing" href="#image-processing"></a> Image processing</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/image_processing/">image processing component</a> currently works with <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/openalpr/">number plates</a>. But this could level the way to integrate feature like facial recognition, motion detection, or gestures control.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="breaking-changes" href="#breaking-changes"></a> Breaking changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.apns/">APNS</a> service was moved to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">notify</code> domain. Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">notify.apns_NOTIFIER_NAME</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">apns.NOTIFIER_NAME</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> component has a new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/#data-migration/">schema</a> to store values in the InfluxDB database. You may require to run the <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/#migration-script/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">influxdb_migrator</code></a> script.
You have to note:
    <ul>
      <li>There will not be any tags/fields named time anymore.</li>
      <li>All numeric fields (int/float/bool) will be stored as float inside influx db.</li>
      <li>All string fields corresponding to state attributes will be renamed as FIELDNAME_str, where FIELDNAME is the state attribute, to avoid type conflicts.</li>
      <li>All string fields corresponding to a state will be renamed as state (former value).</li>
      <li>Fields named value will always be stored as float.</li>
      <li>Fields named state will always be stored as string.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TTS cache files use now the language abbreviation as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">HASH_PLATFORM.xxx</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx</code>.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/03/control-my-christmas-tree-stats/"/>
    <updated>2017-01-03T18:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/03/control-my-christmas-tree-stats</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello and Happy New Year!</p>

<p>I am not Paulus. My name is Ben. I’m the creator of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLecVrux63S6aYiErxdiy4w">BRUH Automation YouTube channel</a>. If you’ve ever seen any of my videos then you’ll know I love home automation and Home Assistant.</p>

<p>I wanted to share some exciting stats from one of my latest projects - <a href="https://github.com/bruhautomation/BRUH-Christmas-Tree-2016">Control My Christmas tree!</a> For this project, I created a Home Assistant instance on a Raspberry Pi 2 that was publically accessible via DuckDNS. Paulus was great in helping me disable several of the developer services that could have been exploited to disable the Home Assistant instance.</p>

<p>I added three devices to the Home Assistant instance - a Wemo Insight, Sonoff Switch (running MQTT firmware), and a DIY MQTT Digital LED strip. After adding a few 3D printed Star War decorations, the tree was ready to go!</p>

<p class="img">
  <img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-01-bruh-christmas/christmas-tree.gif" />
  The Christmas tree in action.
</p>

<!--more-->
<p>During the time by tree was set up, I had 7,366 visitors from 88 countries connect to my Home Assistant instance. This generated an estimated 100,000 clicks on the switches in my Home Assistant instance - thanks in part to some folks who posted up with macros for 6-8 hour stretches.</p>

<p class="img">
  <img src="https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2017-01-bruh-christmas/stats.png" />
  View counts of the video.
</p>

<p>I’m very excited to report that Home Assistant didn’t crash a single time. In fact, it didn’t even bog down or need to be restarted. The Wemo Insight and Sonoff relays were incredibly resilient, as well. I only had one Sonoff failure and two Wemo Insight failures both of which were resolved by power cycling them. The digital LED strips also fared pretty well, hanging up only twice, aside from a loose connector.</p>

<p>I would like to send a big thank you to the Home Assistant developers who have worked so hard on making Home Assistant run so well. This project is a testament to your hard work on making Home Assistant one of the best home automation platforms out there. Thank you!</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to continuing my home automation adventures with Home Assistant and I can’t wait for next Christmas with an even bigger and badder tree. :)</p>

<p>Wishing everyone the best in 2017!</p>

<p>Cheers! -Ben</p>

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/12/19/thank-you/"/>
    <updated>2016-12-19T05:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/12/19/thank-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year ago <a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2015/12/22/amazon-echo-icloud-and-templates/">Home Assistant 0.10</a> landed. Last weekend we released 0.35. Doing 25 releases in a year is a big accomplishment by the community and each release has moved us forwards leaps and bounds. In this year alone we have seen 2800 pull requests on the main repo alone, that’s more than 7 a day!</p>

<p>One of the things that Jon Walker, the founder of the company I work for (<a href="http://www.appfolioinc.com/">AppFolio</a>), has taught me is that the biggest advantage that you can create for yourself compared to your competitors is to release more often. Everytime you release you are able to get the new features into the hands of the users and developers. The faster people start using it, the faster you get feedback on the good and bad parts and thus the faster can you evolve.</p>

<p>That’s why I structured Home Assistant around a two week release cycle. It makes sure that features get out fast and it also forces us to not accumulate a backlog of things to document or test properly. Every two weeks we can start fresh. This makes it easy for new people to start contributing because it’s clear when things go out and people are not afraid to miss a release.</p>

<p>However, being on a two week release cycle also means that the community has to rally each two weeks to make sure everything is ready to go. A lot of people are involved in making sure that all pieces are in place, to all of those: thank you! Thank you for all the time and effort you put in to make Home Assistant the best home automation software out there.</p>

<p>Another big thanks goes out to the developers of the Python language and all the open source libraries and tools that Home Assistant depends on. Making quality software is not a small feat and all of you can be proud of yourself.</p>

<p>Also a big thanks for the companies that offer their services for free to open source projects. Without these we would not be able to operate at our speed or scale. Thanks <a href="https://GitHub.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://Travis-ci.org">TravisCI</a>, <a href="https://CloudFlare.com">CloudFlare</a> and <a href="https://Discourse.com">Discourse</a>!</p>

<p>And finally thank you community for being so helpful and awesome 🙇.</p>

<p>We’re taking a well deserved break and we will be back again in 2017 with more awesomeness. Happy holidays!</p>

<p>– Paulus</p>
