    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/01/14/iss-usps-images-packages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to 2017 and 0.36. We are proud to announce the first release for this year. While we are still migrating parts to async but 0.36 is focusing on new features and a lot of bug fixes.

### <a class='title-link' name='packages' href='#packages'></a> Packages 
[Packages][packages] are providing a new way to organize different component's configuration parts together. With packages we offer the option to include different components or parts of configuration using any of the `!include` directives.

### <a class='title-link' name='influxdb-export' href='#influxdb-export'></a> InfluxDB export 
The [InfluxDB][influx] component was causing problems in a wide variety of use cases. [@titilambert] improved our InfluxDB exporter feature. It might be that you need to run the [migration script](/components/influxdb/#migration-script) to update your InfluxDB database.

```bash
$ hass --script influxdb_migrator \
    -H IP_INFLUXDB_HOST -u INFLUXDB_USERNAME -p INFLUXDB_PASSWORD \
    -d INFLUXDB_DB_NAME
```

### <a class='title-link' name='international-space-station-iss' href='#international-space-station-iss'></a> International Space Station (ISS) 
No, unfortunately we are not going to space. The `iss` sensor is tracking the position of the International Space Station and gives you some details.

### <a class='title-link' name='insteon-local' href='#insteon-local'></a> Insteon local 
The support for Insteon was removed due to issues a while ago. With the `insteon_local` component support for [Insteon][insteon] is back and let one work locally with an Insteon setup.

### <a class='title-link' name='image-processing' href='#image-processing'></a> Image processing 
The new [image processing component][image] currently works with [number plates][plates]. But this could level the way to integrate feature like facial recognition, motion detection, or gestures control.

- [InfluxDB][influx] component has a new [schema](/components/influxdb/#data-migration) to store values in the InfluxDB database. You may require to run the [`influxdb_migrator`](/components/influxdb/#migration-script) script.
  You have to note:
  - There will not be any tags/fields named time anymore.
  - All numeric fields (int/float/bool) will be stored as float inside influx db.
  - All string fields corresponding to state attributes will be renamed as FIELDNAME_str, where FIELDNAME is the state attribute, to avoid type conflicts.
  - All string fields corresponding to a state will be renamed as state (former value).
  - Fields named value will always be stored as float.
  - Fields named state will always be stored as string.
- TTS cache files use now the language abbreviation as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. `HASH_PLATFORM.xxx` -> `HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx`.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[5000 stars on GitHub, 2000 people in out Gitter chatroom and over a million monthly page views. I don't think we could wish for a better place to be at the end of 2016. Feels like an early Christmas present! Our early one for you is 0.35. It's not a single thing inside a nice wrapping, more like several little gifts inside the 0.35 box.

This will be the last release of 2016 as our developers are taking a well deserved break. We will be back in 2017!

## <a class='title-link' name='text-to-speech' href='#text-to-speech'></a> Text to Speech 
With the addition of a [text-to-speech][tts] component by [@pvizeli] we have been able to bring Home Assistant to a whole new level. The text-to-speech component will take in any text and will play it on a media player that supports to play media. We have tested this on Sonos, Chromecast, and Google Home.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke0QuoJ4tRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke0QuoJ4tRM)

## <a class='title-link' name='call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image' href='#call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image'></a> Call for help with HASSbian (our Raspberry Pi image) 
In an effort to make Home Assistant, we're planning to extend the things that people can do out of the box with HASSbian, our Raspberry Pi image. As you might know, the image is currently maintained by [@Landrash]. However he also spends a lot of time on improving the docs and helping out with a ton of other things.

So if you know your Linux-foo and would love to contribute to open source, join the [Hassbian developer chat](https://gitter.im/home-assistant/hassbian) and take a stab at one of [our open issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen/issues).

## <a class='title-link' name='vlc-media-player-broadlink-and-gpslogger' href='#vlc-media-player-broadlink-and-gpslogger'></a> VLC media player, Broadlink, and GPSLogger 
Let you control [VLC media player][vlc-media] and  play sound on connected speakers.

This Broadlink [switch][bl-switch] platform allow to you control Broadlink RM2 Pro and RM mini IR+RF devices. This Broadlink [sensor][bl-sensor] platform adds support for Broadlink RM2 and A1 Devices.

The [GPSLogger](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.gpslogger/) now also supports attributes as the speed, direction, altitude, provider, and activity.

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/12/03/remote-websockets-sonarr/"/>
    <updated>2016-12-03T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/12/03/remote-websockets-sonarr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Here we go... 0.34. Let's call it the "Santa Claus" release. Rudolph was faster than expected and there's lot's of goodies on the sleigh. Of course, more work on async programming done by [@pvizeli] and [@balloob], new components, new platforms, major improvements, and much more.

### <a class='title-link' name='gpslogger' href='#gpslogger'></a> GPSLogger 

The work of [@dainok] let's you use your Android device, with the Geolocation feature enabled, to track itself using GPS or WiFi networks with the [GPSLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger) app. GPSLogger can use multiple sources: the passive one just get the latest Android known location, without activating GPS sensors or scanning for WiFi networks.

###  <a class='title-link' name='remote-component' href='#remote-component'></a> Remote component 

The brand new [`remote`][remote] component made by [@iandday] will simplify the integration of all kinds of remote control units. The first platform for [Harmony][harmony] is included in this release.

### <a class='title-link' name='homematic' href='#homematic'></a> HomeMatic 

The [HomeMatic][homematic] component has received some updates worth mentioning:

* Additional services
  * `reconnect`: Reconnect to your CCU/Homegear without restarting Home Assistant.
  * `set_dev_value`: Manually control a device, even if it's not supported by Home Assistant yet.
* Support for multiple HomeMatic hosts
* Support for HomeMatic Wired (most devices) and HomeMatic IP (a few devices)
* Various improvements and fixes, especially for HM-Sec-Key (KeyMatic)

The support for multiple hosts is a result of allowing mixed configurations with wireless, wired, and IP devices. This has the drawback of making the update a breaking change (along with the renamed `set_value` service). However, the benefits and possibilities gained will be worth it.

### <a class='title-link' name='websocket-api' href='#websocket-api'></a> Websocket API 

This release includes a new [websockets][websockets] based API by [@balloob] to power the next generation of Home Assistant frontends. The current frontend has been partly migrated to use it and will be further migrated in the future.

## <a class='title-link' name='all-changes' href='#all-changes'></a> All changes  

- New services and improved device support for [HomeMatic][homematic] ([@pvizeli], [@danielperna84])
- Device tracker: New support for [GPSLogger][gpslogger] ([@dainok])
- Sensor: Support for [Sonarr][sonarr] ([@hborawski])
- Sensor: [World Air Quality Index][waqi] sensor ([@valentinalexeev], [@fabaff])
- Sensor: Support for [Dutch Smart Meter Requirements][dsmr] ([@aequitas])
- Switch: [Hook][hook] support by hooksmarthome.com ([@dasos])
- Camera: Integration for [Nest cameras][nest-cam] ([@technicalpickles])

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0341---december-4' href='#release-0341---december-4'></a> Release 0.34.1 - December 4 

This release has a bunch of bug fixes including a big one: emulated_hue will now work with Google Home! We usually reserve patch releases for small bug fixes but we considered this more impactful bug fix so important that we're including it now instead of having people wait two weeks.

To make the fix backwards compatible (it is a patch release after all) you will have to add two new configuration option to emulated_hue to have it work with Google Home:

```yaml
emulated_hue:
  type: google_home
  # This is important. Sadly, Google Home will not work with other ports.
  listen_port: 80
```

We are working on a better solution for 0.35.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[For this release we put a lot of focus on finishing our async upgrade and fix a bunch of bugs in the process.

But a new release wouldn't be awesome if it didn't had some new goodies and this release is no different. This release includes a new calendar component by [@mnestor]. It comes now with Google Calendar support, which should allow you to automate things based on your calendar events!

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0331---november-20' href='#release-0331---november-20'></a> Release 0.33.1 - November 20 

 - Fix Z-Wave lights ([@turbokongen])

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0332---november-22' href='#release-0332---november-22'></a> Release 0.33.2 - November 22

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0333---november-23' href='#release-0333---november-23'></a> Release 0.33.3 - November 23

 - Fix discovery race condition (most obvious in Wemo) ([@balloob])

### <a class='title-link' name='release-0334---november-24' href='#release-0334---november-24'></a> Release 0.33.4 - November 24 

 - Set executor pool size to 10 (as intended) ([@pvizeli])

This should fix occasional performance problems that some people have reported.

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 

 - We have included a fix that impacts how we generate entity ids. This only impacts devices with accented characters. Instead of being stripped out, they are now replaced with the non-accented version. So now `Tèst Mörê` will become `test_more` instead of `tst_mr`.
 - Command line switches will now use the specified object ID for their entity ID instead of basing it off the name.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Another two weeks have passed and we are pleased to present Home Assistant 0.32.

### <a class='title-link' name='hacktoberfest' href='#hacktoberfest'></a> Hacktoberfest 
The [Hacktoberfest] is over now. Home Assistant made the 2nd and the 3rd place out of almost 30'000 participating repositories with a total of 528 pull requests closed - that's an average of 17 pull requests a day! Thanks to all the contributors but also to the team of reviewers. This wouldn't been possible without you 👏 .

### <a class='title-link' name='improved-error-reporting' href='#improved-error-reporting'></a> Improved error reporting 
This release has improved the reporting when a config validation error occurs. Thanks to [@kellerza] you will now get a persistent notification added to your UI when this happens.

### <a class='title-link' name='asynchronous' href='#asynchronous'></a> Asynchronous 
This release contains the first asynchronous sensor and camera platforms. [@pvizeli] and [@fabaff] ported most of the "internal" sensors to async programming. We hope that you will enjoy the new speed. 

[@balloob] and [@pvizeli] worked a lot on the improvement of the core itself.

### <a class='title-link' name='weather-component' href='#weather-component'></a> Weather component 

For a long time we have had a bunch of [weather sensors][weather-sensors] but it's getting better: There is now a [Weather component][weather-component]. Sorry, not much more to tell right now. The plans are to create a weather UI element and to improve the initial implementation.
