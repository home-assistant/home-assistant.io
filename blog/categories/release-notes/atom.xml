    <content type="html"><![CDATA[5000 stars on GitHub, 2000 people in out Gitter chatroom and over a million monthly page views. I don't think we could wish for a better place to be at the end of 2016. Feels like an early Christmas present! Our early one for you is 0.35. It's not a single thing inside a nice wrapping, more like several little gifts inside the 0.35 box.

This will be the last release of 2016 as our developers are taking a well deserved break. We will be back in 2017!

## <a class='title-link' name='text-to-speech' href='#text-to-speech'></a> Text to Speech 
With the addition of a [text-to-speech][tts] component by [@pvizeli] we have been able to bring Home Assistant to a whole new level. The text-to-speech component will take in any text and will play it on a media player that supports to play media. We have tested this on Sonos, Chromecast, and Google Home.

## <a class='title-link' name='call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image' href='#call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image'></a> Call for help with HASSbian (our Raspberry Pi image) 
In an effort to make Home Assistant, we're planning to extend the things that people can do out of the box with HASSbian, our Raspberry Pi image. As you might know, the image is currently maintained by [@Landrash]. However he also spends a lot of time on improving the docs and helping out with a ton of other things.

So if you know your Linux-foo and would love to contribute to open source, join the [Hassbian developer chat](https://gitter.im/home-assistant/hassbian) and take a stab at one of [our open issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen/issues).

## <a class='title-link' name='vlc-media-player-broadlink-and-gpslogger' href='#vlc-media-player-broadlink-and-gpslogger'></a> VLC media player, Broadlink, and GPSLogger 
Let you control [VLC media player][vlc-media] and  play sound on connected speakers.

This Broadlink [switch][bl-switch] platform allow to you control Broadlink RM2 Pro and RM mini IR+RF devices. This Broadlink [sensor][bl-sensor] platform adds support for Broadlink RM2 and A1 Devices.

The [GPSLogger](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.gpslogger/) now also supports attributes as the speed, direction, altitude, provider, and activity.

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/12/03/remote-websockets-sonarr/"/>
    <updated>2016-12-03T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/12/03/remote-websockets-sonarr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Here we go... 0.34. Let's call it the "Santa Claus" release. Rudolph was faster than expected and there's lot's of goodies on the sleigh. Of course, more work on async programming done by [@pvizeli] and [@balloob], new components, new platforms, major improvements, and much more.

### <a class='title-link' name='gpslogger' href='#gpslogger'></a> GPSLogger 

The work of [@dainok] let's you use your Android device, with the Geolocation feature enabled, to track itself using GPS or WiFi networks with the [GPSLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger) app. GPSLogger can use multiple sources: the passive one just get the latest Android known location, without activating GPS sensors or scanning for WiFi networks.

###  <a class='title-link' name='remote-component' href='#remote-component'></a> Remote component 

The brand new [`remote`][remote] component made by [@iandday] will simplify the integration of all kinds of remote control units. The first platform for [Harmony][harmony] is included in this release.

### <a class='title-link' name='homematic' href='#homematic'></a> HomeMatic 

The [HomeMatic][homematic] component has received some updates worth mentioning:

* Additional services
  * `reconnect`: Reconnect to your CCU/Homegear without restarting Home Assistant.
  * `set_dev_value`: Manually control a device, even if it's not supported by Home Assistant yet.
* Support for multiple HomeMatic hosts
* Support for HomeMatic Wired (most devices) and HomeMatic IP (a few devices)
* Various improvements and fixes, especially for HM-Sec-Key (KeyMatic)

The support for multiple hosts is a result of allowing mixed configurations with wireless, wired, and IP devices. This has the drawback of making the update a breaking change (along with the renamed `set_value` service). However, the benefits and possibilities gained will be worth it.

### <a class='title-link' name='websocket-api' href='#websocket-api'></a> Websocket API 

This release includes a new [websockets][websockets] based API by [@balloob] to power the next generation of Home Assistant frontends. The current frontend has been partly migrated to use it and will be further migrated in the future.

This release has a bunch of bug fixes including a big one: emulated_hue will now work with Google Home! We usually reserve patch releases for small bug fixes but we considered this more impactful bug fix so important that we're including it now instead of having people wait two weeks.

To make the fix backwards compatible (it is a patch release after all) you will have to add two new configuration option to emulated_hue to have it work with Google Home:

```yaml
emulated_hue:
  type: google_home
  # This is important. Sadly, Google Home will not work with other ports.
  listen_port: 80
```

We are working on a better solution for 0.35.

### <a class='title-link' name='breaking-changes' href='#breaking-changes'></a> Breaking changes 

 - We have included a fix that impacts how we generate entity ids. This only impacts devices with accented characters. Instead of being stripped out, they are now replaced with the non-accented version. So now `Tèst Mörê` will become `test_more` instead of `tst_mr`.
 - Command line switches will now use the specified object ID for their entity ID instead of basing it off the name.

    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2016/11/05/hacktoberfest-influxdb-weather</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Another two weeks have passed and we are pleased to present Home Assistant 0.32.

### <a class='title-link' name='hacktoberfest' href='#hacktoberfest'></a> Hacktoberfest 
The [Hacktoberfest] is over now. Home Assistant made the 2nd and the 3rd place out of almost 30'000 participating repositories with a total of 528 pull requests closed - that's an average of 17 pull requests a day! Thanks to all the contributors but also to the team of reviewers. This wouldn't been possible without you 👏 .

### <a class='title-link' name='improved-error-reporting' href='#improved-error-reporting'></a> Improved error reporting 
This release has improved the reporting when a config validation error occurs. Thanks to [@kellerza] you will now get a persistent notification added to your UI when this happens.

### <a class='title-link' name='asynchronous' href='#asynchronous'></a> Asynchronous 
This release contains the first asynchronous sensor and camera platforms. [@pvizeli] and [@fabaff] ported most of the "internal" sensors to async programming. We hope that you will enjoy the new speed. 

[@balloob] and [@pvizeli] worked a lot on the improvement of the core itself.

### <a class='title-link' name='weather-component' href='#weather-component'></a> Weather component 

For a long time we have had a bunch of [weather sensors][weather-sensors] but it's getting better: There is now a [Weather component][weather-component]. Sorry, not much more to tell right now. The plans are to create a weather UI element and to improve the initial implementation.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again friend,

How are you? Having a good day? We sure are. If you aren't having a good day, this might cheer you up...

Every other weekend around here gets a little hectic leading to a big sigh of relief as we release a new version of Home Assistant to the world. And this time is no different. Our developer community has once again built us a beautiful new release with lots of new features and improvements. We hope you like it.

One last thing before we get going though, I should warn you... [@balloob] got a bit lazy this week and let me ([@robbiet480]) step up to the plate again to write the blog post and do the release. I guess I didn't do such a bad job in [0.27][zero-two-seven-release]. You'll never know what surprises I have in store. Now that i've got all that stuff out of the way, let's get started...

## <a class='title-link' name='stats-update' href='#stats-update'></a> Stats Update 
Sadly, no big amazing stats to update you with this time, but we did recently pass 7,000 commits! This release featured submissions from 45 contributors. Hopefully with the new updater component we will be able to give you some really good stats in the 0.32 blog post.

## <a class='title-link' name='hacktoberfest' href='#hacktoberfest'></a> Hacktoberfest 

![Hacktoberfest logo][logo]

October means Hacktoberfest time and our community has really come through with some excellent improvements and additions. As of this writing, we have 194 merged and 41 open pull requests to the [home-assistant repository][hacktoberfest-ha-prs] and 209 merged/28 open pull requests submitted to the [home-assistant.github.io repository][hacktoberfest-site-prs]. If you want to get in on the fun check out our [Hacktoberfest][hacktoberfest-blog] blog post or the [Hacktoberfest website][hacktoberfest-website]. You get an awesome t-shirt for free if you have 4 pull requests merged in the month of October! We even have tasks that a non-developer can easily accomplish with a tiny bit of work. Better hurry up though, only 9 days left and most of the easy tasks are gone!

## <a class='title-link' name='-a-greatly-improved-updater-component-please-read-this-' href='#-a-greatly-improved-updater-component-please-read-this-'></a> ⚠️ A greatly improved updater component (Please read this!) ⚠️ 

This release includes an update to our [updater] component. The responsibility of the updater component is to check if a new version is available and notify the user if this is the case.

It used to be that this component would check with [PyPi] (the Python package manager) to see if a new update was available. This had a couple of problems:

 1. We are unable to do a slow rollout
 2. We are unable to show the user extra information (like a link to a changelog or the release date)
 3. We are unable to warn users for critical security updates

So to work around these problems, we decided to start hosting the version check service ourselves. Since we had to get some infrastructure spun up anyway, we figured we would take it a step further. Which leads me to this bit of the update (the most important part):

### <a class='title-link' name='what-you-need-to-know-the-important-bit' href='#what-you-need-to-know-the-important-bit'></a> What you need to know (the important bit!) 

Remember how I mentioned that up there in the title that there is some serious business in this release? Well, we also added some basic analytics to the updater component which get sent to the server and stored so that we get a better idea of our user base.

Each Home Assistant instance running the updater component will generate a [unique ID][UUID] (based on UUIDv4) that will be used for the updater to be able to differentiate between instances. This UUID will be stored in your config directory in a file called `.uuid`.

#### Opting out

There are two ways to opt-out. The first way is by using the new `opt_out` option for the updater. This way the updater will continue to check for updates, but no information about your system will be shared with us.

```yaml
updater:
  reporting: no
```

You can also disable the updater component entirely by removing `updater:` from your `configuration.yaml` although **we would not suggest you do this** as you would miss any critical updates.

Finally, you can also reset your unique identifier by deleting the `.uuid` file and restarting Home Assistant.

#### Data stored on the Home Assistant update server

Here is what my production Home Assistant instance looks like from the server side:

| Name                  | Description                                | Example                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `arch`                | CPU Architecture                           | `x86_64`                           |
| `distribution`        | Linux Distribution name (only Linux)       | `Ubuntu`                           |
| `docker`              | True if running inside Docker              | `false`                            |
| `os_name`             | Operating system name                      | `Darwin`                           |
| `os_version`          | Operating system version                   | `10.12`                            |
| `python_version`      | Python version                             | `3.5.2`                            |
| `timezone`            | Timezone                                   | `America/Los_Angeles`              |
| `user_agent`          | User agent used to submit analytics        | `python-requests/2.11.1`           |
| `uuid`                | Unique identifier                          | `10321ee6094d4a2ebb5ed55c675d5f5e` |
| `version`             | Home Assistant version                     | `0.31.0`                           |
| `virtualenv`          | True if running inside virtualenv          | `true`                             |

In addition to the above collected data, the server will also use your IP address to do a geographic IP address lookup to determine the city that you are from. To be extremely, extremely clear about this bit: __The Home Assistant updater does not: store your IP address in a database and also does not submit the location information from your `configuration.yaml`.__

<p class='img'>
  <img src='https://home-assistant.io/images/blog/2016-10-flash-briefing-updater-hacktoberfest/map.png' />
  Geo-lookup on my IP resolves to Oakland with latitude/longitude pointing at the geographical center of the city.
</p>

The server also adds two timestamps to the data: the original date your instance UUID was first seen and the timestamp of the last time we have seen your instance. This gives us the following extra data:

| Name                  | Description                                | Example                            |

This data is held in the highest security. The update system runs in a secured Amazon Web Services account owned by me ([@robbiet480]). I personally have 5 years of experience with complex AWS deployments and have an extensive security background. I have audited the entire system and made sure to take every step to protect the data, including limiting who has access (just [@balloob] and myself). While not directly personally identifiable we absolutely understand some users hesistance to giving this information out. Please understand that we are only collecting this information to better understand our user base to provide better long term support and feature development then is currently possible.

We currently have no plans to publicly expose any of this information. If we did do such a thing in the future we would of course notify you in advance. It must also be stated that we will never sell or allow the use of this information for non-Home Assistant purposes.

We thank you for understanding why we are collecting this data and hope that you leave the feature enabled but fully understand if you feel uncomfortable with this.

Now, back to the fun stuff...

## <a class='title-link' name='good-evening-im-ron-burgundy-and-heres-what-happening-in-your-world-tonight' href='#good-evening-im-ron-burgundy-and-heres-what-happening-in-your-world-tonight'></a> Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy and here's what happening in your world tonight. 

Home Assistant got a crazy idea recently that it couldn't do enough already and wanted to challenge itself even more. I really don't understand how it came up with this kooky idea, but it now thinks that its newest hobby should be a minor career in journalism.

0.31 adds support for the brand spanking new [Alexa Flash Briefing API](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/flash-briefing), allowing you to get updates from Home Assistant anytime you ask Alexa to read your flash briefing. What's the use case you ask? Well, now when I wake up in the morning and get my flash briefing, Home Assistant adds this to the end of it for me:

> Drive time with traffic is 35 minutes. There is an UberPOOL that will cost $11.52, estimated to be 2 minutes away, for a total of 37 minutes. BART is currently estimated to take 29 minutes. You should take BART, as it is estimated to be faster by 8 minutes.

Now I know how to best get to [my real job][runway] (no, Home Assistant is _not_ my real job, it does seem like it sometimes though) every morning. Obviously not the best home automation example, but I think you get the idea. I could see this being used to tell you any major events that happened in your home overnight or reading you your hyperlocal weather report. Thanks to the audio support you could even replace all of the default Alexa Flash Briefing sources with your own news feeds. Home Assistant supports both text and audio content as well as displaying data in the Alexa app. I also want to point out that unlike the existing Skill integration, the Flash Briefing API does _not_ require HTTPS (_but you should still be using HTTPS if possible_). For more information, check out the new [docs][flash-briefing-docs].

  You stay classy, San Diego. (It's funny, because balloob lives in San Diego))

## <a class='title-link' name='major-breaking-z-wave-changes-ahead' href='#major-breaking-z-wave-changes-ahead'></a> Major breaking Z-Wave changes ahead 

A rather nasty Z-Wave [issue][z-wave-issue] was discovered recently by [@lukas-hetzenecker]. There was a somewhat large chance that if you had multiple of the same model Z-Wave device they may both try to use the same entity IDs. To fix the issue the internal Z-Wave index is now appended to the end of all Z-Wave entity IDs.

What this means for all you Z-Wave users is that you will need to update your configurations to reflect the change. I personally have quite a few (17) Z-Wave devices and went through the process this week. Here's what I had to do:

- Update customizations
- Update groups
- Update my `zwave.customize` section
- Update my Alexa skills that used old entity IDs
- Because I use `emulated_hue` with Alexa and `emulated_hue` uses the entity ID as a unique identifier I also had to remove all Z-Wave devices from Alexa and re-add them.

Your todo list may be a little different from mine, I just wanted to outline the steps I took to give you an idea of what you need to think about. It's not a very hard process, especially when using global find and replace in Sublime Text but did take me about 20 minutes to complete.

This is super annoying, I know, especially since we had said in [0.12][zero-one-two-release] that Z-Wave IDs should hopefully never change again, but we are now forced to eat those words. I will state again that Z-Wave IDs shouldn't change in the future but obviously we see how that went. To sum up on this section... sorry but it had to happen.
