    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the main complaints that we receive is something along the lines “I read that X is possible yet I am unable to find it on the website.”. This post is to announce that we have taken the first steps to improve it by revamping the <a href="/getting-started/">getting started</a> and <a href="/developers/">developers</a> sections. It’s still a work in progress but we now have a solid foundation to build on for the future 👍.</p>

<p>Our documentation has been going through various phases. Initially it was just the README in our GitHub repository. I discovered Jekyll and GitHub pages in December 2014 and created home-assistant.io. I more or less broke the README in 5 pages and <a href="/blog/2014/12/18/website-launched/">called it a website</a>. Back then we had a whopping <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/blob/86bb2df430ce267ab2123d51592d3f068ae509b5/source/components/index.markdown">11 components</a>.</p>

<p>As Home Assistant grew, so did our documentation. <a href="https://github.com/fabaff">Fabian Affolter</a> does an amazing job in making sure there is at least a documentation stub for each new feature that lands. And that’s quite a feat given our <a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/categories/release-notes/">frequent releases</a>! But despite all the efforts, the documentation outgrew our existing documentation organisation.</p>

<p>Today it has been almost 1.5 years since we started the website. We now have <a href="/components/">264 components and platforms</a> under our belt and have been honored with 1.5 million page views ✨. And hopefully we now also have documentation that our community deserves.</p>

<p>Finally, if you see some content that could use more clarifcation or is outdated, don’t hesitate to use the ‘Edit in GitHub’ link that is present on each page.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally took the time to setup a simple website to help people getting started with Home Assistant. The process was super smooth thanks to the great tools <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and the great services <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a>.</p>
