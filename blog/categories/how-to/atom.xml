    <content type="html"><![CDATA[When Let's Encrypt launched we were estatic: finally an easy and free way for our users to securely access their homes remotely. Let's Encrypt signifianctly lowered the bar to get and renew SSL certificates. However, this process could still be quite an obstacle for our users. It required opening ports on the router and remembering to renew the certificate every so often.

Thanks to a [blog post][splitbrain] by Andreas Gohr I realized that DuckDNS supports setting TXT records, making it compatible with the DNS-01 challenge of Let's Encrypt. The DNS-01 challenge is using the DNS record of the domain instead of interacting with the server. This means that it's not needed for the user to open any ports!

I have worked together with [Pascal Vizeli][pvizeli] on updating the DuckDNS add-on for Hass.io and today we're proud to announce it now includes automatic generation and updating of Let's Encrypt certificates for your DuckDNS domain. The only thing that you have to add to your DuckDNS configuration is that you accept the Let's Encrypt [terms of service][terms] and point Home Assistant at the generated certificates and you're good to go. No other work is required.

To get started today, start with making sure that you have [Hass.io installed][hassio]. After that, go to the Hass.io panel in Home Assistant, open the add-on store, scroll down to DuckDNS and install it. In the DuckDNS settings change "accept_terms" to true and start it.

Next up is to configure Home Assistant with the config below and restart it. You're now good to go! Make sure to use the right protocol when browsing to your instance: `https://<your_domain>.duckdns.org`. Happy secure controlling your house!

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for the HTTP component
http:
  ssl_certificate: /ssl/fullchain.pem
  ssl_key: /ssl/privkey.pem
```

If you're not using Hass.io, check out the [blog post][splitbrain] by Andreas for instructions.

    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/05/13/home-assistant-on-orange-pi-zero</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This blog post is about the setup of Home Assistant on an [Orange Pi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/). Like the setup on a [Raspberry Pi Zero](/blog/2017/05/01/home-assistant-on-raspberry-pi-zero-in-30-minutes/) it will only take a couple of minutes to get a fully functional super cheap (less than 18 Euro incl. casing and power supply) Home Assistant hub. The reasons to use an Orange Pi Zero beside the prize are the built-in Ethernet port and the availability. 

<p class="img">

<!--more-->

Download the [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-zero/) and create the SD card with [Etcher](https://etcher.io/). There is no possibility to connect a display to the Orange Pi Zero. This means that you need a wired network setup with DHCP server. After your Orange Pi Zero is running, give it some time, and look for its IP address. The hostname is `orangepizero`.

If you found the IP address then use your SSH client to connect to the Orange Pi Zero. The default password is `1234`.

```bash
$ ssh root@192.168.0.151

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/05/01/home-assistant-on-raspberry-pi-zero-in-30-minutes/"/>
    <updated>2017-05-01T09:00:00+00:00</updated>

  <img src="/images/blog/2017-05-hassbian-pi-zero/home_assistant_plus_rpi_600x315.png" />
</p>

Saw the [announcement](/blog/2017/04/30/hassbian-1.21-its-about-time/) yesterday for HASSbian 1.21 and got super excited? 

Today we'll flash the latest HASSbian to a [Raspbery Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/).
**With an added bonus** that besides for an USB cable for power, there's no need for any cables!

What you'll need:
- a Raspberry Pi Zero W (an amazing tiny computer with built-in wifi)
- a microSD card
- some source of USB power
- Wifi
- a desktop or laptop

Let's get to it!

First, download the HASSbian 1.21 image from [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen/releases/tag/v1.21).

Unzip it.

Flash it to the microSD card. If you need a flash tool, try [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) 

When the flashing finishes, remove it and plug it back in. You should see a drive called "boot". 

Right in there, not in any folders, create a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf`.

The contents of the configuration file should be something like this:
(You may have to adjust for your configuration, hints [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md) )

```
network={
    ssid="YOUR_WIFI_NETWORK_NAME_HERE"
    psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD_HERE"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Next stick your SD card into the Raspberry Pi Zero W, and plug it in.

After about a minute, use your SSH client to connect to HASSbian (or `hassbian.local` from a Mac), with the username `pi`. The default password is `raspberry`.

It's a good idea to change the password. To do so, use the `passwd` command.

Next, type the following two commands into the SSH console:

```
$ sudo systemctl enable install_homeassistant.service
$ sudo systemctl start install_homeassistant.service
```

Wait about 15-20 minutes and voilà you have your Home Assistant on your Raspberry Pi Zero W in 30 minutes.

To try it out, go to [http://hassbian:8123](http://hassbian:8123) or [http://hassbian.local:8123](http://hassbian.local:8123) if you're using Mac.

For further details about HASSbian, take a look at the [documentation](https://home-assistant.io/docs/hassbian/).

    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/04/25/influxdb-grafana-docker/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-25T08:04:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/04/25/influxdb-grafana-docker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Home Assistant collects volumes of (time series) data that are well suited for some fancy graphs. Although the [History](https://home-assistant.io/components/history/) component provides some nice plots, I am sure you have always wanted those fancy [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) plots. The problem, however, is that low-powered device such as Raspberry Pi that most of us use for our Home Assistant setup are not well suited for such operation.

Instead of running [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) and Grafana on a Raspberry Pi or a different system and go through the [classic approach of installing both tools separately](/blog/2015/12/07/influxdb-and-grafana/), you can run them in a Docker container on another machine. For this tutorial, I am using a Synology NAS, but the instructions should apply to other devices that can run Docker. Just follow the steps below:

1.	SSH into your NAS. You may have to run `sudo su` if you are getting permission errors.
2.	Download the [docker-statsd-influxdb-grafana]( https://hub.docker.com/r/samuelebistoletti/docker-statsd-influxdb-grafana/) image using the command:
`docker pull samuelebistoletti/docker-statsd-influxdb-grafana`
3.	To start the container for the first-time launch:
    ```
    docker run -d \
      --name docker-statsd-influxdb-grafana \
      -p 3003:3003 \
      -p 3004:8083 \
      -p 8086:8086 \
      -p 22022:22 \
      -p 8125:8125/udp \
      samuelebistoletti/docker-statsd-influxdb-grafana:latest
    ```
4.	The image should now be running and both InfluxBD and Grafana should be now up and running.
5.	You can access InfluxDB at http://NAS_IP_ADDRESS:3004/ and Grafana at http://NAS_IP_ADDRESS:3003/
6.	Navigate to http://NAS_IP_ADDRESS:3004/ and create the database `home_assistant` using the command `CREATE DATABASE home_assistant`.
    <p class='img'>
      <img src='/images/blog/2017-04-influxdb-grafana/create_HA_database.png' />
    </p>
7.	Now, you need to configure Home Assistant to use InfluxDB. Since, we did not add any username/password to our database, we can simply add the following to our configuration.yaml (replace the IP address with that of the device running Docker) and restart Home Assistant to setup InfluxDB (you will have to fine tune it based on your preferences):
    ```
    influxdb:
      host: 192.168.2.113
    ```
8.	Next, we need to configure Grafana to use InfluxDB. Navigate to http://NAS_IP_ADDRESS:3003/ to access Grafana (login with username and password `root`) and add your first data source. Here’s how you can configure Grafana to use InfluxDB database. Note that 192.168.2.113 is the IP address of my NAS.
    <p class='img'>
      <img src='/images/blog/2017-04-influxdb-grafana/add_data_source.png' />
    </p>
9.	You should see `Data source is working` if you have configured everything correctly.
10.	With all that configured, you are now ready for the fun stuff. You can create as many dashboards as you want and then import the same in Home Assistant.
11.	To add the Grafana dashboard in HA, use the following config:
    ```
    panel_iframe:
      router:
        title: 'Temperature'
        url: 'http://192.168.2.113:3003/dashboard/db/temperature?edit&tab=time%20range'
    ```
    The URL can be obtained by clicking Share Dashboard link on your dashboard:
    <p class='img'>
      <img src='/images/blog/2017-04-influxdb-grafana/share_dashboard.png' />

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[HTTP to MQTT bridge]]></title>
    <link href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/28/http-to-mqtt-bridge/"/>
    <updated>2017-03-28T06:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/03/28/http-to-mqtt-bridge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[The idea of creating [HTTP to MQTT bridge](https://github.com/petkov/http_to_mqtt) appeared when I was trying to integrate Google Assistant with my Home Assistant after watching [BRUH Automation](https://youtu.be/087tQ7Ly7f4?t=265) video. Right now there is no MQTT service available in [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/about). Existing integration solution uses [Maker Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) which requires that your Home Assistant instance is publically accessible, which I think brings some security concerns or simply not always possible to set up.

The HTTP to MQTT bridge should fill that gap. The idea is to receive messages using HTTP requests and transfer them to your MQTT broker, which can be contacted by Home Assistant. The HTTP to MQTT bridge is written using Node.js with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the server part and [MQTT.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt) for the client.

<!--more-->

The app could be hosted on any Node.js hosting. I prefer [Heroku: Cloud Application Platform](https://www.heroku.com/home) for its simplicity.

### <a class='title-link' name='bringing-pieces-together' href='#bringing-pieces-together'></a> Bringing pieces together 

1. Configure the Home Assistant [MQTT trigger](https://home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#mqtt-trigger).
1. Configure [CloudMQTT](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/). Check this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaWdvVVYU3A) for details.
1. [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/petkov/http_to_mqtt) HTTP to MQTT bridge app.
1. Add the [Configuration Variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#setting-up-config-vars-for-a-deployed-application) to your Heroku app mentioned here.
   * AUTH_KEY: Can be any string, eg. `912ec803b2ce49e4a541068d495ab570`.
   * MQTT_HOST: The host of your MQTT broker, eg. mqtts://k99.cloudmqtt.com:21234.
   * MQTT_USER: MQTT username
   * MQTT_PASS: MQTT password
1. Create an IFTTT applet the same way as described in [BRUH Automation](https://youtu.be/087tQ7Ly7f4?t=265) video.
1. Configure [Maker Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks) service with below parameters.
   * URL: `https://<app_name>.herokuapp.com/post/`
   * Method: `POST`
   * Content Type: `application/json`
   * Body: `{"topic":"<mqtt_topic>","message":"<mqtt_message>","key":"<AUTH_KEY>"}`

### <a class='title-link' name='subscribe-to-latest-version' href='#subscribe-to-latest-version'></a> Subscribe to latest version 

Additionally you can make Heroku to update the HTTP to MQTT bridge app to the latest available version from the GitHub repository automatically. To do this follow the instruction on the [Heroku help page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys).

### <a class='title-link' name='improve-response-time' href='#improve-response-time'></a> Improve response time 

After 30 minutes of inactivity Heroku will put your app into sleep mode. This will result in ~10 seconds response time. To prevent Heroku from putting your app into sleep mode, ping it every 10 minutes. You can do that by sending regular HTTP GET request to http://your_app/keep_alive/. But be careful. Heroku free quota is 550 hours per month. Without sleeping your app will be allowed to run only 22 days a month. Additionally the `keep_alive` method will send a simple MQTT message to prevent the broker from sleeping as well. The topic and message can be configured using Heroku environment variables `KEEP_ALIVE_TOPIC` and `KEEP_ALIVE_MESSAGE` and both are set to "keep_alive" by default.

You can even configure Home Assistant to ping HTTP to MQTT bridge every 10 minutes during daytime. Below is an example of how to do that:

```yaml
rest_command:
  http_to_mqtt_keep_alive:
    url: https://<your_app_address>/keep_alive/
    method: get

automation:
  alias: HTTP to MQTT keep alive
  trigger:
    platform: time
    minutes: '/10'
    seconds: 00
  condition:
    condition: time
    after: '7:30:00'
    before: '23:59:59'
  action:
    service: rest_command.http_to_mqtt_keep_alive
```

### <a class='title-link' name='thanks' href='#thanks'></a> Thanks 

Special thanks to Ben from [BRUH Automation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLecVrux63S6aYiErxdiy4w/featured) for awesome tutorials which inspired me to do this project.
