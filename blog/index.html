  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    <p>The Home Assistant project and community has seen enormous growth in the last three years. Many volunteers work tirelessly everyday to give you all the awesomeness that you see today. Much more work is involved than many people realize. Beyond simply coding Home Assistant, volunteers continually maintain related projects, update documentation, post examples, author blog posts, and moderate the forums and chat. This is something that we want to keep safe and functional, even as we grow.</p>

<p>Starting today we are announcing a few initiatives to help protect our users, contributors and community members.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="code-of-conduct" href="#code-of-conduct"></a> Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>More people are getting to know and love Home Assistant every day and our community keeps growing. Our community consists of people from all over the world with different backgrounds and we want Home Assistant to be a place where everyone can feel at home. To help with this we’re introducing a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct describes what type of behavior is unacceptable, how we will enforce it and where to report incidents.</p>

<p>Moving forward this Code of Conduct will be active for all projects within the Home Assistant organisation.</p>

<p><a href="/developers/code_of_conduct/">Read the Code of Conduct</a></p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="contributor-license-agreement" href="#contributor-license-agreement"></a> Contributor License Agreement</h2>

<p>Moving forward we will also require that all contributors to any project have electronically signed a contributor license agreement (CLA). We have adopted the CLA that GitHub uses for their projects. Currently we have no plans to retroactively require a CLA for previous contributions, only those going forward.</p>

<p>Until a signed CLA is on file your pull request will not be reviewed or accepted. When you open a new pull request, if you do not have a CLA on file, our helpful bot will walk you through the steps to complete the process.</p>

<p><strong>We intend to require an electronically signed contributor licensing agreement for all contributors beginning with our next release (0.37), currently scheduled for release on Saturday, January 28th, 2017 (one week from today).</strong> The CLA is being added to all repositories today.</p>

<p>A CLA is difficult to describe but GitHub did an excellent job so this next section is taken from <a href="https://cla.github.com/">https://cla.github.com</a>:</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="what-is-a-contributor-license-agreement" href="#what-is-a-contributor-license-agreement"></a> What is a Contributor License Agreement?</h3>

<p>A Contributor License Agreement, known as a CLA, asks contributors to confirm that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Anyone can use your contributions anywhere, for free, forever.</li>
  <li>Your contributions do not infringe on anyone else’s rights.</li>
</ol>

<p>The GitHub CLA helps ensure the smooth operation and usability of the open source projects that we maintain.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="why-is-a-cla-necessary" href="#why-is-a-cla-necessary"></a> Why is a CLA necessary?</h3>

<p>It depends on the jurisdiction, but in the United States, contributions are owned by the author or their employer. When the contribution is accepted, the project becomes a bundle of derivative works. The agreement of all contributors are necessary to maintain distribution of the complete project and to any licensing agreement.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="isnt-that-the-purpose-of-an-open-source-license" href="#isnt-that-the-purpose-of-an-open-source-license"></a> Isn’t that the purpose of an open source license?</h3>

<p>Most open source licenses deal with use of the original code, and don’t refer to contributions, or derivatives of the original.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="how-does-a-cla-protect-a-project" href="#how-does-a-cla-protect-a-project"></a> How does a CLA protect a project?</h3>

<p>If the owner of a contribution decides that they don’t want the contribution to be part of the project or in any given distribution, the law is on their side. The project, contributors, and users may be subject to legal action. This may require payment of damages and could prevent further usage or contributions until the matter is resolved.</p>

<p>Even when there is no legal pursuit, too much ambiguity can jeopardize or doom a project by preventing those that can’t risk legal action from getting involved.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="why-does-it-seem-like-only-corporate-projects-have-a-cla" href="#why-does-it-seem-like-only-corporate-projects-have-a-cla"></a> Why does it seem like only “corporate” projects have a CLA?</h3>

<p>There are many projects without corporate ownership that use a CLA or even a copyright assignment: jQuery and Eclipse, for example. However, it is true that projects with financial backing tend to be at a higher risk of becoming a target, so they may have a lower tolerance for legal ambiguity.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="what-makes-the-github-cla-different-from-other-clas" href="#what-makes-the-github-cla-different-from-other-clas"></a> What makes the GitHub CLA different from other CLAs?</h3>

<p>The GitHub CLA does not include benign terms that serve no purpose, nor does it include pernicious terms that try to grab more rights than necessary to protect users of the project. Accepting the CLA is a low-overhead click-through when making a pull request, and it only needs to be accepted on the first contribution to a project or organization.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="security-requirements" href="#security-requirements"></a> Security requirements</h2>

<p>With more collaborators involved with Home Assistant we are also exposing ourselves to more risk as more people have write access. As such we taking the following steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>As of November 3rd, 2016, all collaborators have been required to have 2 factor authentication (2FA) enabled on their GitHub account.</li>
  <li>Going forward, we will do an audit from time to time and strip collaborators from write access if they haven’t contributed for a while. This is in no sense meant to boot people, and you are absolutely eligible to get it back in the future when you wish start contributing again.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="licensing" href="#licensing"></a> Licensing</h2>

<p>We will now ensure that a <code class="highlighter-rouge">LICENSE.md</code> file exists in all projects under the Home Assistant organization and is an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">OSI approved open source license</a> or a <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="code-license" href="#code-license"></a> Code License</h3>

<p>The chosen license for all code projects under the Home Assistant organization is The MIT License.</p>

<p>The core Home Assistant project has been licensed under the MIT license since almost the beginning of the project and is the most chosen license for open source projects.</p>

<p>Wikipedia has this to say about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has therefore an excellent license compatibility. The MIT license permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. The MIT license is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL); MIT licensed software can be integrated into GPL software, but not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="documentation-license" href="#documentation-license"></a> Documentation License</h3>

<p>All content on home-assistant.io and all other documentation/asset projects under the Home Assistant organization will be licensed under the Creative Commons License, specifically the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a> license.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="crediting-contributors" href="#crediting-contributors"></a> Crediting contributors</h2>

<p>We have now mostly automated updating the <a href="/developers/credits/">Credits</a> page so that contributors get their attribution more quickly.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="in-closing" href="#in-closing"></a> In closing</h2>

<p>We hope you understand that our desire with these changes is only to help protect the amazing community that has been built around Home Assistant. If you have any questions, please contact me via email, Twitter or Gitter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    <p>It’s week 3 of 2017 and great things did already happen. This is just a little recap.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <a href="https://ossmetrics.com/leaderboard">OSS Metrics leaderboard</a> we are on place 30. Within three months we moved from our starting place which was 66 in September 2016 up to the current one.</li>
  <li>We were listed on <a href="https://github.com/trending/python">Github Trending</a>. Also, was <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> mentioned as trending developer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>’s talk at the OpenIoT Summit 2016 was rated as one of the <a href="http://technewsdir.com/top-5-videos-from-embedded-linux-conference-and-openiot-summit-2016">Top 5 videos</a> of the conference.</li>
  <li>We now ship over <a href="/components/#all">500</a> components and platforms.</li>
  <li>We processed over 3500 Pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant">main repository</a> so far.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may ask yourself why this is amazing. It’s amazing because we are a community-only project driven by volunteers there is no financial support, no company in the background, and no paid developers who are working on Home Assistant. Here is another “Thank you” because you are the driving force behind Home Assistant.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    <p>Welcome to 2017 and 0.36. We are proud to announce the first release for this year. While we are still migrating parts to async but 0.36 is focusing on new features and a lot of bug fixes.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="packages" href="#packages"></a> Packages</h3>
<p><a href="https://home-assistant.io/topics/packages/">Packages</a> are providing a new way to organize different component’s configuration parts together. With packages we offer the option to include different components or parts of configuration using any of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">!include</code> directives.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="influxdb-export" href="#influxdb-export"></a> InfluxDB export</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> component was causing problems in a wide variety of use cases. <a href="https://github.com/titilambert">@titilambert</a> improved our InfluxDB exporter feature. It might be that you need to run the <a href="/components/influxdb/#migration-script">migration script</a> to update your InfluxDB database.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$ </span>hass --script influxdb_migrator <span class="se">\</span>
    -H IP_INFLUXDB_HOST -u INFLUXDB_USERNAME -p INFLUXDB_PASSWORD <span class="se">\</span>
    -d INFLUXDB_DB_NAME
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="international-space-station-iss" href="#international-space-station-iss"></a> International Space Station (ISS)</h3>
<p>No, unfortunately we are not going to space. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">iss</code> sensor is tracking the position of the International Space Station and gives you some details.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="insteon-local" href="#insteon-local"></a> Insteon local</h3>
<p>The support for Insteon was removed due to issues a while ago. With the <code class="highlighter-rouge">insteon_local</code> component support for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/insteon_local/">Insteon</a> is back and let one work locally with an Insteon setup.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="image-processing" href="#image-processing"></a> Image processing</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/image_processing/">image processing component</a> currently works with <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/openalpr/">number plates</a>. But this could level the way to integrate feature like facial recognition, motion detection, or gestures control.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="breaking-changes" href="#breaking-changes"></a> Breaking changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.apns/">APNS</a> service was moved to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">notify</code> domain. Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">notify.apns_NOTIFIER_NAME</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">apns.NOTIFIER_NAME</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/influxdb/">InfluxDB</a> component has a new <a href="/components/influxdb/#data-migration">schema</a> to store values in the InfluxDB database. You may require to run the <a href="/components/influxdb/#migration-script"><code class="highlighter-rouge">influxdb_migrator</code></a> script.
You have to note:
    <ul>
      <li>There will not be any tags/fields named time anymore.</li>
      <li>All numeric fields (int/float/bool) will be stored as float inside influx db.</li>
      <li>All string fields corresponding to state attributes will be renamed as FIELDNAME_str, where FIELDNAME is the state attribute, to avoid type conflicts.</li>
      <li>All string fields corresponding to a state will be renamed as state (former value).</li>
      <li>Fields named value will always be stored as float.</li>
      <li>Fields named state will always be stored as string.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TTS cache files use now the language abbreviation as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">HASH_PLATFORM.xxx</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx</code>.</li>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    <p>Hello and Happy New Year!</p>

<p>I am not Paulus. My name is Ben. I’m the creator of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLecVrux63S6aYiErxdiy4w">BRUH Automation YouTube channel</a>. If you’ve ever seen any of my videos then you’ll know I love home automation and Home Assistant.</p>

<p>I wanted to share some exciting stats from one of my latest projects - <a href="https://github.com/bruhautomation/BRUH-Christmas-Tree-2016">Control My Christmas tree!</a> For this project, I created a Home Assistant instance on a Raspberry Pi 2 that was publically accessible via DuckDNS. Paulus was great in helping me disable several of the developer services that could have been exploited to disable the Home Assistant instance.</p>

<p>I added three devices to the Home Assistant instance - a Wemo Insight, Sonoff Switch (running MQTT firmware), and a DIY MQTT Digital LED strip. After adding a few 3D printed Star War decorations, the tree was ready to go!</p>

<p class="img">
  <img src="/images/blog/2017-01-bruh-christmas/christmas-tree.gif" />
  The Christmas tree in action.
</p>

<p>During the time by tree was set up, I had 7,366 visitors from 88 countries connect to my Home Assistant instance. This generated an estimated 100,000 clicks on the switches in my Home Assistant instance - thanks in part to some folks who posted up with macros for 6-8 hour stretches.</p>

<p class="img">
  <img src="/images/blog/2017-01-bruh-christmas/stats.png" />
  View counts of the video.
</p>

<p>I’m very excited to report that Home Assistant didn’t crash a single time. In fact, it didn’t even bog down or need to be restarted. The Wemo Insight and Sonoff relays were incredibly resilient, as well. I only had one Sonoff failure and two Wemo Insight failures both of which were resolved by power cycling them. The digital LED strips also fared pretty well, hanging up only twice, aside from a loose connector.</p>

<p>I would like to send a big thank you to the Home Assistant developers who have worked so hard on making Home Assistant run so well. This project is a testament to your hard work on making Home Assistant one of the best home automation platforms out there. Thank you!</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to continuing my home automation adventures with Home Assistant and I can’t wait for next Christmas with an even bigger and badder tree. :)</p>

<p>Wishing everyone the best in 2017!</p>

<p>Cheers! -Ben</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    <p>A year ago <a href="https://home-assistant.io/blog/2015/12/22/amazon-echo-icloud-and-templates/">Home Assistant 0.10</a> landed. Last weekend we released 0.35. Doing 25 releases in a year is a big accomplishment by the community and each release has moved us forwards leaps and bounds. In this year alone we have seen 2800 pull requests on the main repo alone, that’s more than 7 a day!</p>

<p>One of the things that Jon Walker, the founder of the company I work for (<a href="http://www.appfolioinc.com/">AppFolio</a>), has taught me is that the biggest advantage that you can create for yourself compared to your competitors is to release more often. Everytime you release you are able to get the new features into the hands of the users and developers. The faster people start using it, the faster you get feedback on the good and bad parts and thus the faster can you evolve.</p>

<p>That’s why I structured Home Assistant around a two week release cycle. It makes sure that features get out fast and it also forces us to not accumulate a backlog of things to document or test properly. Every two weeks we can start fresh. This makes it easy for new people to start contributing because it’s clear when things go out and people are not afraid to miss a release.</p>

<p>However, being on a two week release cycle also means that the community has to rally each two weeks to make sure everything is ready to go. A lot of people are involved in making sure that all pieces are in place, to all of those: thank you! Thank you for all the time and effort you put in to make Home Assistant the best home automation software out there.</p>

<p>Another big thanks goes out to the developers of the Python language and all the open source libraries and tools that Home Assistant depends on. Making quality software is not a small feat and all of you can be proud of yourself.</p>

<p>Also a big thanks for the companies that offer their services for free to open source projects. Without these we would not be able to operate at our speed or scale. Thanks <a href="https://GitHub.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://Travis-ci.org">TravisCI</a>, <a href="https://CloudFlare.com">CloudFlare</a> and <a href="https://Discourse.com">Discourse</a>!</p>

<p>And finally thank you community for being so helpful and awesome 🙇.</p>

<p>We’re taking a well deserved break and we will be back again in 2017 with more awesomeness. Happy holidays!</p>

<p>– Paulus</p>

    <p>5000 stars on GitHub, 2000 people in out Gitter chatroom and over a million monthly page views. I don’t think we could wish for a better place to be at the end of 2016. Feels like an early Christmas present! Our early one for you is 0.35. It’s not a single thing inside a nice wrapping, more like several little gifts inside the 0.35 box.</p>

<p>This will be the last release of 2016 as our developers are taking a well deserved break. We will be back in 2017!</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="text-to-speech" href="#text-to-speech"></a> Text to Speech</h2>
<p>With the addition of a <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/tts/">text-to-speech</a> component by <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a> we have been able to bring Home Assistant to a whole new level. The text-to-speech component will take in any text and will play it on a media player that supports to play media. We have tested this on Sonos, Chromecast, and Google Home.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke0QuoJ4tRM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke0QuoJ4tRM</a></p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image" href="#call-for-help-with-hassbian-our-raspberry-pi-image"></a> Call for help with HASSbian (our Raspberry Pi image)</h2>
<p>In an effort to make Home Assistant, we’re planning to extend the things that people can do out of the box with HASSbian, our Raspberry Pi image. As you might know, the image is currently maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Landrash">@Landrash</a>. However he also spends a lot of time on improving the docs and helping out with a ton of other things.</p>

<p>So if you know your Linux-foo and would love to contribute to open source, join the <a href="https://gitter.im/home-assistant/hassbian">Hassbian developer chat</a> and take a stab at one of <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen/issues">our open issues</a>.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="vlc-media-player-broadlink-and-gpslogger" href="#vlc-media-player-broadlink-and-gpslogger"></a> VLC media player, Broadlink, and GPSLogger</h2>
<p>Let you control <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.vlc/">VLC media player</a> and  play sound on connected speakers.</p>

<p>This Broadlink <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.broadlink/">switch</a> platform allow to you control Broadlink RM2 Pro and RM mini IR+RF devices. This Broadlink <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/sensor.broadlink/">sensor</a> platform adds support for Broadlink RM2 and A1 Devices.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.gpslogger/">GPSLogger</a> now also supports attributes as the speed, direction, altitude, provider, and activity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    <p>Here we go… 0.34. Let’s call it the “Santa Claus” release. Rudolph was faster than expected and there’s lot’s of goodies on the sleigh. Of course, more work on async programming done by <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a> and <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a>, new components, new platforms, major improvements, and much more.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="gpslogger" href="#gpslogger"></a> GPSLogger</h3>

<p>The work of <a href="https://github.com/dainok">@dainok</a> let’s you use your Android device, with the Geolocation feature enabled, to track itself using GPS or WiFi networks with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mendhak.gpslogger">GPSLogger</a> app. GPSLogger can use multiple sources: the passive one just get the latest Android known location, without activating GPS sensors or scanning for WiFi networks.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="remote-component" href="#remote-component"></a> Remote component</h3>

<p>The brand new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/remote/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">remote</code></a> component made by <a href="https://github.com/iandday">@iandday</a> will simplify the integration of all kinds of remote control units. The first platform for <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/remote.harmony/">Harmony</a> is included in this release.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="homematic" href="#homematic"></a> HomeMatic</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/homematic/">HomeMatic</a> component has received some updates worth mentioning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Additional services
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">reconnect</code>: Reconnect to your CCU/Homegear without restarting Home Assistant.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">set_dev_value</code>: Manually control a device, even if it’s not supported by Home Assistant yet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Support for multiple HomeMatic hosts</li>
  <li>Support for HomeMatic Wired (most devices) and HomeMatic IP (a few devices)</li>
  <li>Various improvements and fixes, especially for HM-Sec-Key (KeyMatic)</li>
</ul>

<p>The support for multiple hosts is a result of allowing mixed configurations with wireless, wired, and IP devices. This has the drawback of making the update a breaking change (along with the renamed <code class="highlighter-rouge">set_value</code> service). However, the benefits and possibilities gained will be worth it.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="websocket-api" href="#websocket-api"></a> Websocket API</h3>

<p>This release includes a new <a href="https://home-assistant.io/developers/websocket_api/">websockets</a> based API by <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> to power the next generation of Home Assistant frontends. The current frontend has been partly migrated to use it and will be further migrated in the future.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="release-0341---december-4" href="#release-0341---december-4"></a> Release 0.34.1 - December 4</h3>

<p>This release has a bunch of bug fixes including a big one: emulated_hue will now work with Google Home! We usually reserve patch releases for small bug fixes but we considered this more impactful bug fix so important that we’re including it now instead of having people wait two weeks.</p>

<p>To make the fix backwards compatible (it is a patch release after all) you will have to add two new configuration option to emulated_hue to have it work with Google Home:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s">emulated_hue</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">google_home</span>
  <span class="c1"># This is important. Sadly, Google Home will not work with other ports.</span>
  <span class="s">listen_port</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">80</span>
</code></pre>

Home Assistant made the 2nd and the 3rd place out of almost 30’000 participating repositories with a total of 528 pull requests closed - that’s an average of 17 pull requests a day! Thanks to all the contributors but also to the team of reviewers. This wouldn’t been possible without you 👏 .</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="improved-error-reporting" href="#improved-error-reporting"></a> Improved error reporting</h3>
<p>This release has improved the reporting when a config validation error occurs. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kellerza">@kellerza</a> you will now get a persistent notification added to your UI when this happens.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="asynchronous" href="#asynchronous"></a> Asynchronous</h3>
<p>This release contains the first asynchronous sensor and camera platforms. <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fabaff">@fabaff</a> ported most of the “internal” sensors to async programming. We hope that you will enjoy the new speed.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pvizeli">@pvizeli</a> worked a lot on the improvement of the core itself.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="weather-component" href="#weather-component"></a> Weather component</h3>

<p>For a long time we have had a bunch of <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/#weather">weather sensors</a> but it’s getting better: There is now a <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/weather/">Weather component</a>. Sorry, not much more to tell right now. The plans are to create a weather UI element and to improve the initial implementation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    <p>On Saturday, we released <a href="/blog/2016/10/22/flash-briefing-updater-hacktoberfest/#comment-2965607849">Home Assistant 0.31</a> which includes an improved updater component that checks for new versions using the Home Assistant servers. We wanted to update the community on its rollout and answer some questions that have come up. As part of the update check anonymous information about your operating system and Python version is submitted to Home Assistant servers unless you have opted out.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="why-we-changed-the-updater" href="#why-we-changed-the-updater"></a> Why we changed the updater</h2>
<p>This change was driven by two important factors.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="improving-the-security-of-the-users" href="#improving-the-security-of-the-users"></a> Improving the security of the users.</h3>

<p>As a user, you will be able to be notified if you are running a Home Assistant version that includes components that have known security flaws.</p>

<p>Although we hope to not have to use this feature often, it is important for us to be able to reach out to impacted users. We had the need for such a feature once in the past. Due to a bug the forecast.io sensor was making a huge amount of API requests causing some of our users to get charged because they went over the free quota.</p>

<p>Please note that this functionality is not done yet but will be available in a future release.</p>

<h3><a class="title-link" name="focusing-our-resources-where-it-matters" href="#focusing-our-resources-where-it-matters"></a> Focusing our resources where it matters</h3>

<p>As developers of Home Assistant, we will be able to see in what kind of environments Home Assistant is running. Here’s a few data points we didn’t have until now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total number of instances</li>
  <li>Which operating systems versions and flavors are in use</li>
  <li>Python version</li>
  <li>What option is more popular: Docker, Virtualenv or bare metal installs?</li>
  <li>How popular is our new <a href="/blog/2016/10/01/we-have-raspberry-image-now/">Raspberry Pi image</a>?</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="why-we-look-up-your-ip-address-with-geoip" href="#why-we-look-up-your-ip-address-with-geoip"></a> Why we look up your IP address with GeoIP</h2>
<p>We store the city so that we can see where our users are from. This information will be used to give us a better insight in where our users are from. This will help us gather data to see if we should for example prioritize internationalization. In addition, we previously had a nasty bug with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sun</code> component in which users above a certain latitude were having crashes multiple times a day. Had the updater component been in place we could have targeted a special priority update notification only to them.</p>

<p>As stated in the release blog post, the location information is <em>not</em> provided by your local Home Assistant installation but is instead gathered by comparing your IP address against the <a href="https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/">GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind</a>. From their documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IP geolocation is inherently imprecise. Locations are often near the center of the population. Any location provided by a GeoIP database should not be used to identify a particular address or household.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="why-is-it-enabled-by-default" href="#why-is-it-enabled-by-default"></a> Why is it enabled by default</h2>
<p>We decided to have it enabled by default because we consider the information that is gathered not harmful. We understand that not everyone will agree with us and so we have provided <a href="/components/updater/">multiple ways to opt out</a>.</p>

<p>It is in our short-term planning to add an option to control this to our frontend.</p>

<h2><a class="title-link" name="source-code" href="#source-code"></a> Source Code</h2>
<p>The source code of our updater AWS Lambda function is now available <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/Analytics-Receiver">here</a>.</p>
