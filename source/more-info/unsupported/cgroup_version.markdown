## The issue

Supervisor depends on a particular version of Docker CGroup to be in use since
it depends on its features to work properly.

Currently Supervisor requires CGroup v1 in a supervised installation. 

However, the feature set changes and improves over time and therefore, the minimal
required version may change in the future. When that happens, it will be communicated
before we publish a version that will require you to upgrade CGroups.

## The solution

In a supervised installation if you have switched to CGroup v2 you will need to
revert what you did. Or you can re-run the [supervised installer](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer)
to fix it.

You should never see this issue on Home Assistant OS as all versions of the OS
ship with a supported CGroup version.
