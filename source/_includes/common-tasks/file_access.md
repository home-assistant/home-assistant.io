## Configuring access to files

Your Home Assistant Operating server includes two repositories by default: The official core add-on repository, and the community add-on repository. All of the add-ons mentioned here can be installed by navigating to the add-on store using {% my supervisor_store title="Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store" %} in the UI.

One of the first things to take care of after installing Home Assistant OS is to provide yourself access to files. There are several add-ons commonly used for this, and most users employ a mix of various add-ons. Default directories on the host are mapped to the add-ons so that they can be accessed by the services any particular add-on might provide. On the host system these directories exist on the `/data` partition at `/mnt/data/supervisor/`.

Using any of the add-ons listed below, the following directories are made available for access:

- `addons`
- `backup`
- `config`
- `media`
- `share`
- `ssl`

### Installing and using the Samba add-on

The Samba add-on creates smb shares which can be accessed from another computer. You can also edit files using the editor of your preference from your client computer. This add-on can be installed from the add-on store's official repository.

To configure the Samba add-on, you only need to set a user and password of your choice on the configuration page, save, and then start the add-on. The add-on will not start without setting a password!

To connect to the Samba server from another device, you will use the IP address or hostname of your server. Either of these can be found on the {% my network title="Settings > System > Network" %} page of your UI.

For connecting from Windows 10, you can enter the IP address or hostname in File Explorer's address bar with two backslashes, as shown in the example screenshot.

You should then be prompted for the credentials you entered in the Samba add-on configuration. You also have the option of having the credentials stored so that you do not need to enter them again. After that, you'll have access to the directories which you can then mount as a drive or pin to Quick Access.


For OS X, connecting to the shares is a matter of using the Finder menu > Go > Connect to Server...
You would then enter the IP address or hostname of your Home Assistant OS instance as `smb://your.ha.ip.address` or `smb://homeassistant` and enter your credentials when prompted.

### Installing and using the SSH add-on

If you want to use the Home Assistant command line or an SSH client, you can do this through the **Terminal & SSH** add-on.

The **Terminal & SSH** add-on provides the following functionalities:

- It provides a web terminal that you can access from the Home Assistant user interface.
- It allows you to use the Home Assistant Command Line Interface (CLI) which provides custom commands for checking logs, stopping and starting Home Assistant and add-ons, creating/restoring backups, and more.
  - For a list of command line commands, refer to [Home Assistant via Command Line](/common-tasks/os#home-assistant-via-the-command-line).
- It allows connecting to your system using an SSH client.
- It also includes common tools like nano and vi editors.
- The Terminal & SSH add-on does **not provide** access to the underlying host file system.

To get started with the **Terminal & SSH** add-on, follow these steps:

1. In the bottom left, select your user to open the {% my profile title="**Profile**" %} page. Make sure **Advanced Mode** is enabled.
2. To install the add-on, go to the add-on store under [**Settings** > **Add-ons**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_ssh) and install the **Terminal & SSH** add-on.
3. To use the web terminal, **start** the add-on, then select **Open Web UI**.
   - You can now start typing your [commands](/common-tasks/os#home-assistant-via-the-command-line).
4. If you want to access from an ssh client, you need to enter credentials:
   - Open the **Configuration** page.
   - Enter a password or authorized Keys.
   - Then save and start the add-on.

### Installing and using the Visual Studio Code (VSC) add-on

The **Studio Code Server** add-on provides access through a feature-packed web-based version of the Visual Studio Code editor. It currently only supports AMD64 and aarch64/ARM64 machines. The add-on also provides access to the Home Assistant Command Line Interface (CLI) using VSC's built-in terminal, which allows for checking logs, stopping, and starting Home Assistant and add-ons, creating/restoring backups, and more. (See [Home Assistant via Command Line](/hassio/commandline/) for further info).

To install and use the  **Studio Code Server** in Home Assistant, follow these steps:

1. To install the add-on, go to {% my supervisor_addon title="**Settings** > **Add-ons** > **Studio Code Server**" addon="a0d7b954_vscode" %} and install the add-on.
2. Once you have the add-on installed, if you want, select the **Show in sidebar** option. Then, select **Start**.
3. For information on configuration settings, open the **Documentation** tab.
4. To start browsing, on the **Info** tab, select **Open Web UI**.

### Installing and using the File Editor add-on

The **File Editor** add-on is a web-based file system browser and text editor. It is a more basic and light weight alternative to Visual Studio Code. YAML files are automatically checked for syntax errors while editing.

To install and use the File Editor in Home Assistant, follow these steps:

1. To install the add-on, go to {% my supervisor_addon title="**Settings** > **Add-ons** > **File editor**" addon="core_configurator" %}.
   - Once you have the add-on installed, you can edit files within your `/config` directory.
2. If you want to be able to access directories outside the `/config` directory, in the add-on, open the **Configuration** tab and disable the **Enforce basepath** option.
   - Note: The **Enforce basepath** option is intended to protect you from inadvertently making changes to settings files.
3. For information on other configuration settings, open the **Documentation** tab.
4. To confirm your changes, select **Save**.
5. To start browsing, on the **Info** tab, select **Open Web UI**.
