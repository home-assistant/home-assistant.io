Best practice for updating Home Assistant Core:

1. Backup your installation{% if page.installation == "os" or page.installation == "supervised" %}, using the [backup functionality](/common-tasks/os/#backups) Home Assistant offers{% endif %}.
2. Check the release notes for backward-incompatible changes on [Home Assistant release notes](/blog/categories/core/). Be sure to check all release notes between the version you are running and the one you are upgrading to. Use the search function in your browser (`CTRL + f` / `CMD + f`) and search for **Backward-incompatible changes**.
{% if page.installation == "os" or page.installation == "supervised" %}
3. Select **Create backup before updating** in case you encounter an issue that requires a rollback.
4. Update Home Assistant.
5. Review persistent notifications and log to see if there are any issues with your configuration that need to be addressed.
