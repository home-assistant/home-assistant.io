## Enabling or disabling entities

Some entities are disabled by default. Or have been disabled previously.

There are different ways to enable entities. You can enable a single entity in the entity settings, or you can enable multiple entities at once from the list of entities.

### To enable or disable a single entity

1. Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %} and select your integration card.
2. Select the device.
3. Select the entity of interest, select the cogwheel {% icon "mdi:cog-outline" %}, then select the toggle for **Enable**.
4. Select **Update**.
5. Confirm the notification stating that it will take about 30 seconds for the entity to become enabled. Select **OK**.
