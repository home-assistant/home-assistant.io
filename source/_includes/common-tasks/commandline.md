### Console access

You can also access the {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %} via a directly connected keyboard and monitor, the console.

#### Wiping the data disk wipe from the command line

In {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}, the `ha os datadisk wipe` command wipes the data disk. The command deletes all user data as well as Home Assistant Core, Supervisor, and any installed add-ons.

The command `ha os datadisk wipe` marks the data partition (either internal on the eMMC or the SD card, or on an external attached data disk) as to be cleared on the next reboot. The command automatically reboots the system. Upon reboot, the data is cleared. Then the system continues to boot and reinstalls the latest version of all Home Assistant components.

The `ha os datadisk wipe` command can only be run from the local terminal. Connect a display and keyboard and use the terminal.

Note, if you have a Home Assistant Yellow, there is a red hardware button to wipe the data disk. Follow the procedure on [resetting the device](https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/factory-reset/).

#### Listing all users from the command line

In {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}, the `ha auth list` command lists all users that are registered on your Home Assistant.

The `ha auth list` command can only be run from the local terminal. Connect a display and keyboard and use the terminal.
