{% if page.installation_type == 'generic-x86-64' %}

<div class='note'>
<b>Prerequisites</b>

This guide assumes that you have a dedicated {{ site.installation.types[page.installation_type].board }} PC to exclusively run the Home Assistant Operating System.

- This is typically an Intel or AMD-based system.
- The system must be 64-bit capable and be able to boot using UEFI.
  - Most systems produced in the last 10 years support the UEFI boot mode.

<b>Summary</b>

1. First, you will need to configure your {{ site.installation.types[page.installation_type].board }} PC to use UEFI boot mode.
2. Then, write the Home Assistant Operating System disk image to your boot medium.

</div>

## Configure the BIOS on your x86-64 hardware

To boot Home Assistant OS, the BIOS needs to have UEFI boot mode enabled and Secure Boot disabled. The following screenshots are from a 7th generation Intel NUC system. The BIOS menu will likely look different on your system. However, the options should still be present and named similarly.

1. To enter the BIOS, start up your x86-64 hardware and repeatedly press the `F2` key (on some systems this might be `Del`, `F1` or `F10`).
![Enter BIOS using F2, Del, F1 or F10 key](/images/installation/intel-nuc-enter-bios.jpg)

2. Make sure the UEFI Boot mode is enabled.
![Enable UEFI Boot mode](/images/installation/intel-nuc-uefi-boot.jpg)

3. Disable Secure Boot.
![Disable Secure Boot mode](/images/installation/intel-nuc-disable-secure-boot.jpg)

4. Save your changes and exit.

The BIOS configuration is now complete.

## Write HAOS onto your x86-64 hardware

Next, you need to write the Home Assistant Operating System image to the *boot medium*, which is the medium your x86-64 hardware will boot from when it is running Home Assistant.

<div class='note'>
HAOS has no integrated installer that writes the image automatically. You will write it manually using either the <b>Disks</b> utility from Ubuntu or Balena Etcher.
</div>

Typically, an internal medium like S-ATA hard disk, S-ATA SSD, M.2 SSD, or a non-removable eMMC is used for the x86-64 boot medium. Alternatively, an external medium can be used such as a USB SDD, though this is not recommended.

To write the HAOS image to the boot medium on your x86-64 hardware, there are 2 different methods:

  **Method 1 (recommended)**: Boot Ubuntu from a USB flash drive and install the Home Assistant Operating System from there. It also works on laptops and PCs with internal hard disks.

  **Method 2**: With this method, you write the Home Assistant Operating disk image directly onto a boot medium from your regular computer. The steps are a bit more complex. If you have non-removable internal mediums (for example because you are using a laptop) or do not have the necessary adapter (for example an USB to S-ATA adapter) use method 1 instead.

### Method 1: Installing HAOS via Ubuntu booting from a USB flash drive

#### Required material

- Computer
- The target x86-64 hardware, on which you want to install the Home Assistant Operating System (HAOS)
- USB flash drive (USB thumb drive is sufficient, it should be at least 4&nbsp;GB in size)
- Internet connection

#### To install HAOS via Ubuntu from a USB flash drive

1. **Notice**: This procedure will write the Home Assistant Operating System onto your device.
   - This means you will lose all the data as well as the previously installed operating system.
   - Back up your data before carrying out this procedure.
2. Create a *live operating system* on a USB flash drive:
   - Follow the [Ubuntu instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install) on writing an Ubuntu iso file onto a USB device.
3. Insert the USB flash drive into the system on which you want to run Home Assistant.
   - Boot the live operating system.
   - You might need to adjust boot order or use F10 (might be a different F-key depending on the BIOS) to select the USB flash drive as boot device.
4. When prompted, make sure to select **Try Ubuntu**. This runs Ubuntu on the USB flash device.
   - The system then starts Ubuntu.
   - Connect your system to your network and make sure it has internet access.
5. In Ubuntu, open a browser and open the current documentation page, so you can follow the steps.
   - From there, [download the image][generic-x86-64].
6. In Ubuntu, in the bottom left corner, select **Show Applications**.
7. In the applications, search and open **Disks** and start restoring the HAOS image:
   1. In **Disks**, on the left side, select the internal disk device you want to install HAOS onto.
   2. On top of the screen, select the three dots menu and select **Restore Disk Image...**.
      ![Restore disk image: select three dots menu](/images/installation/ubuntu_restore_disk_image.png)
   3. Select the image you just downloaded.
      ![Restore disk image: select image](/images/installation/select_haos.png)
   4. Select **Start Restoring...**.
      ![Restore disk image: start restoring](/images/installation/start_restoring.png)
   5. Confirm by selecting **Restore**.
      ![Restore disk image: select Restore](/images/installation/restore.png)
      - If you are getting an **Error unmounting filesystem** error message, stating that the **target is busy**:
      - Most likely, you are running Ubuntu on your internal disk. Instead, you need to run it on your stick.
        - Go back to step 3 and during start up, make sure you select **Try Ubuntu** (and NOT **Install Ubuntu**).
   6. In the partitions overview, you should now see the restore operation in progress.
      - The Home Assistant Operating System is now being installed on your system.
        ![Restore disk image: Restoring...](/images/installation/haos_restoring.png)
8. Once the Home Assistant Operating System is installed, shut down the system.
   - Once Ubuntu has been shut down, remove the USB flash drive (Ubuntu will inform you when this is the case).
   - Your Home Assistant server is now set up and you can start using it.
   - To use it, proceed as described under [start up your generic x86-64](/installation/generic-x86-64#start-up-your-generic-x86-64).

### Method 2: Installing HAOS directly from a boot medium

Use this method only if Method 1 does not work for you.

#### Required material

- Computer
- The target x86-64 hardware, on which you want to install the Home Assistant Operating System (HAOS)
- Boot medium
- Internet connection

#### Write the image to your boot medium

### Start up your {{site.installation.types[page.installation_type].board}}

{% if page.installation_type == 'generic-x86-64' %}

- If you used method 1 for the installation, make sure the USB flash drive is removed from the system.

- If you used method 2 for the installation, install the boot medium into your x86-64 hardware.

1. Plug in an Ethernet cable that is connected to the network.
2. Power the system on. If you have a screen connected to the {{site.installation.types[page.installation_type].board}} system, after a minute or so the Home Assistant welcome banner will appear in the console.

<div class="note">

If the machine complains about not being able to find a bootable medium, you might need to specify the EFI entry in your BIOS.
This can be accomplished either by using a live operating system (e.g. Ubuntu) and running the following command (replace `<drivename>` with the appropriate drive name assigned by Linux, typically this will be `sda` or `nvme0n1` on NVMe SSDs):

  ```text
  efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/<drivename> --part 1 --label "HAOS" \
     --loader '\EFI\BOOT\bootx64.efi'
  ```

The efibootmgr command will only work if you booted the live operating system in UEFI mode, so be sure to boot from your USB flash drive in this mode.
Depending on your privileges on the prompt, you may need to run efibootmgr using sudo.

Or else, the BIOS might provide you with a tool to add boot options, there you can specify the path to the EFI file:

  ```text
  \EFI\BOOT\bootx64.efi
  ```

</div>

{% else %}

1. Insert the boot medium ({{ site.installation.types[page.installation_type].installation_media }}) you just created.
2. Plug in an Ethernet cable that is connected to the network and power the system on.

{% endif %}

3. In the browser of your desktop system, within a few minutes you will be able to reach your new Home Assistant at <a href="http://homeassistant.local:8123" target="_blank">homeassistant.local:8123</a>.

<div class="note">
If you are running an older Windows version or have a stricter network configuration, you might need to access Home Assistant at <a href="http://homeassistant:8123" target="_blank">homeassistant:8123</a> or `http://X.X.X.X:8123` (replace X.X.X.X with your {{site.installation.types[page.installation_type].board}}’s IP address).
</div>

{% else %}

### Download the appropriate image

- [VirtualBox][vdi] (.vdi)
{% if page.installation_type == 'linux' %}
- [KVM][qcow2] (.qcow2)
{% elsif page.installation_type == 'alternative' %}
- [KVM/Proxmox][qcow2] (.qcow2)
- [VMware ESXi/vSphere][Virtual Appliance] (.ova)
{% endif %}
{% if page.installation_type == 'windows' %}
- [VMware Workstation][vmdk] (.vmdk)
- [Hyper-V][vhdx] (.vhdx)
{% endif %}

After downloading, decompress the image. If the image comes in a ZIP file, for example, unzip it.

Follow this guide if you already are running a supported virtual machine hypervisor. If you are not familiar with virtual machines, install Home Assistant OS directly on a [Home Assistant Yellow](/installation/yellow), a [Raspberry Pi](/installation/raspberrypi), or an [ODROID](/installation/odroid).

{% if page.installation_type == 'macos' %}

- If VirtualBox is not supported on your Mac, and you have experience using virtual machines, you can try running the Home Assistant Operating System on [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/).
{% endif %}

### Create the virtual machine

Load the appliance image into your virtual machine hypervisor. (Note: You are free to assign as much resources as you wish to the VM, please assign enough based on your add-on needs).

Minimum recommended assignments:

- 2 GB RAM
- 32 GB Storage
- 2vCPU

*All these can be extended if your usage calls for more resources.*

    ```

    <div class="note info">
    If you have a USB dongle to attach, you need to add the option `--hostdev busID.deviceId`. You can discover these IDs via the `lsusb` command.
    As example, if `lsusb` output is:

    ```bash
       Bus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
       Bus 003 Device 004: ID 30c9:0052 Luxvisions Innotech Limited Integrated RGB Camera
       Bus 003 Device 003: ID 1a86:55d4 QinHeng Electronics SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus V2
       Bus 003 Device 002: ID 06cb:00fc Synaptics, Inc. 
       Bus 003 Device 005: ID 8087:0033 Intel Corp. 
       Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
       Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
       Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
    ```

    You can recognize the Sonoff dongle at `Bus 003 Device 003`. So the command to install the VM will become:

    ```bash
    virt-install --name hass --description "Home Assistant OS" --os-variant=generic --ram=2048 --vcpus=2 --disk <PATH TO QCOW2 FILE>,bus=sata --import --graphics none --boot uefi --hostdev 003.003
    ```

    Note that this configuration (bus 003, device 003) is just an example, your dongle could be on another bus and/or with another device ID.
    Please check the correct IDs of your USB dongle with `lsusb`.

1. Start the virtual machine.
2. Observe the boot process of the Home Assistant Operating System.
3. Once completed, you will be able to reach Home Assistant on <a href="http://homeassistant.local:8123" target="_blank">homeassistant.local:8123</a>. If you are running an older Windows version or have a stricter network configuration, you might need to access Home Assistant at <a href="http://homeassistant:8123" target="_blank">homeassistant:8123</a> or `http://X.X.X.X:8123` (replace X.X.X.X with your {{site.installation.types[page.installation_type].board}}’s IP address).
