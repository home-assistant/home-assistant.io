Home Assistant is built from the ground up to be easily extensible using components. Home Assistant uses [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for the backend and [Polymer (Web components)](https://www.polymer-project.org/) for the frontend.

Home Assistant is open-source and licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). Here are links to the source:
