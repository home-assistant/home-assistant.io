<p>
  Add-ons allow the user to extend the functionality around Home
    Assistant by installing additional applications.
</p>
<p>
  This can be running an application that Home Assistant can integrate with
    (like an MQTT broker) or to share the configuration via Samba for easy editing
    from other computers. Add-ons can be configured via the Supervisor panel in Home
    Assistant.

  Add-ons for Home Assistant are freely available in the add-on store.
</p>

<p>
  To install add-ons, navigate to the Supervisor panel in your Home Assistant
    frontend, and click on the "Add-on store" tab. All add-ons, including their documentation, are available right from the store.
    Some advanced add-ons will only be visible after you opt-in to "Advanced Mode" which can be changed on your user profile page.
    Click on an add-on you are interested in, to read the documentation or to install the add-on.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Add-ons are only available if you've used the Home Assistant Operating System or 
  Home Assistant Supervised <a href="/installation">installation</a> method. If you
  installed Home Assistant using any other method then you cannot use add-ons.
  Often you can achieve the same manually, refer to the documentation by the
  vendor of the application you'd like to install.
