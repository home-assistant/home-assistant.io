After Home Assistant has been installed, there are 5 steps to log in and see your devices.

### Step 1

- Enter the Home Assistant address in your browser:
   - Typically, this is `http://homeassistant.local:8123/`.
   - If you are running an older Windows version or have a stricter network configuration, you might need to access Home Assistant at `homeassistant:8123` or `http://X.X.X.X:8123` (replace X.X.X.X with your device’s IP address).

### Step 2

You can either create a new installation or recover an existing installation from a backup.

- To create a new installation, select **Create my Smart Home**.

   - **Result**: This will create an administrator account. It will always be able to change everything in Home Assistant. 
   - Enter your name, username, and password and select **Create Account**. 
   - Be sure to save this information safely, as there is no way to recover it.

- If you want to restore from a backup of a previous installation, select **Restore from backup**.

    - Continue with the procedure on restoring from backup. You can ignore the remaining steps listed on this page

### Step 3

1. Enter the location of your home. 
  - The location is used to configure the time zone, unit system, and currency. It is also used for automations that would show the weather, open the shades at sunrise, or start the vacuum when you leave the home. 
  - You can always change this information later in settings.

2. After finding your location, select **Next**.

### Step 4

Home Assistant can use anonymous information about your system to improve the product. This is disabled by default. However, we encourage you to share some of this data as it helps us find out where to focus our efforts.  


The data is anonymized and aggregated. To see the charts we generate out of this data, take a look at our [analytics page](https://analytics.home-assistant.io/)

- Once you are done, select **Next**.

### Step 5

Home Assistant will try to find any devices it has discovered on your network. What shows up depends on the devices in your home. Don’t worry if you don’t see anything but your name at the top. You can add more devices later.

- Select **Finish**.

You’ve now got Home Assistant up and running.
