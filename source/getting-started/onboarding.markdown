After Home Assistant has been [installed](/installation/) on your device, there are 5 steps to complete setting up Home Assistant.

1. Enter the following URL into the browser's address bar: [http://homeassistant.local:8123/](http://homeassistant.local:8123/).
   - **Result**: You now see the **Preparing Home Assistant** page. Depending on your hardware and internet connection, preparation may take a while.
     - Home Assistant downloads the latest version of {% term "Home Assistant Core" %} (about 700&nbsp;MB).
   - If you ran into issues with this step, refer to the [installation troubleshooting](/installation/troubleshooting/).
   - Once preparation is finished, the welcome screen is shown.

2. You can either create a new installation or recover an existing installation from a backup:
   - **Option 1: new installation**: If this is your initial installation, we will now create the owner's account of Home Assistant.
     - {% icon "mdi:information-outline" %} This account is an administrator account. It will always be able to change everything.
     - Select **Create my smart home**.
     - Enter a name, username, and password.
       - Make sure the username is lowercase and contains no whitespace.
     - Store the name, username, and password somewhere safe. There is no way to recover the owner credentials.
     - Select **Create account**.

   - **Option 2: restore from backup**: If you want to restore a backup of a previous installation, select **Restore from backup**.
     - Ignore the rest of this procedure and continue with the procedure on [restoring from backup](/common-tasks/os/#restoring-a-backup).
       - If you have a Home Assistant Yellow, start with the [Yellow documentation on restoring from backup](https://yellow.home-assistant.io/guides/restore-backup/).
       - If you have a Home Assistant Green, start with the [Green documentation on restoring from backup](https://green.home-assistant.io/guides/restore-backup/).

3. Enter the location of your home.
   - The home location is used to configure the time zone, unit system, and currency.
   - It is also used to create the home [zone](/integrations/zone/), which designates the area of your home with a default radius of 100&nbsp;m.
   - You can always change this information later in the settings.
   - This home zone can be used for automations such as showing the weather, opening the shades at sunrise, or starting the vacuum when you leave the home.
   - After finding your location, select **Next**.

    - Select **Finish**.
