Now you're in Home Assistant, let's look at the most important concepts.

## Integrations

Integrations are pieces of software that allow Home Assistant to connect to other software and platforms. For example, a product by Philips called Hue would use the Philips Hue {% term integration %} and allow Home Assistant to talk to the hardware controller Hue Bridge. Any Home Assistant compatible {% term devices %} connected to the Hue Bridge would appear in Home Assistant as [devices](#devices).

For a full list of compatible {% term integrations %}, refer to the [integrations](/integrations) documentation.

Once an {% term integration %} has been added, the hardware and/or data are represented in Home Assistant as [devices and entities](#devices).

## Entities

Entities are the basic building blocks to hold data in Home Assistant. An {% term entity %} represents a {% term sensor %}, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other {% term entities %}. An {% term entity %} is usually part of a {% term device %} or a {% term service %}. Entities have {% term states %}.

## Devices

Devices are a logical grouping for one or more {% term entities %}. A {% term device %} may represent a physical {% term device %}, which can have one or more sensors. The sensors appear as entities associated with the {% term device %}. For example, a motion sensor is represented as a {% term device %}. It may provide motion detection, temperature, and light levels as {% term entities %}. Entities have states such as *detected* when motion is detected and *clear* when there is no motion.

Devices and entities are used throughout Home Assistant. To name a few examples:

- [Dashboards](/getting-started/onboarding_dashboard/) can show a state of an {% term entity %}. For example, if a light is on or off.
- An [automation](#automations) can be triggered from a state change on an {% term entity %}. For example, a motion sensor entity detects motion and triggers a light to turn on.
- A predefined color and brightness setting for a light saved as a [scene](#scenes).

## Automations

A set of repeatable {% term actions %} that can be set up to run automatically. Automations are made of three key components:

1. Triggers - events that start an {% term automation %}. For example, when the sun sets or a motion sensor is activated.
2. Conditions - optional tests that must be met before an {% term action %} can be run. For example, if someone is home.
3. Actions - interact with {% term devices %} such as turn on a light.

To learn the basics about {% term automations %}, refer to the [automation basics](/docs/automation/basics/) page or try [creating an automation](/getting-started/automation) yourself.

## Scripts

Similar to {% term automations %}, scripts are repeatable {% term actions %} that can be run. The difference between {% term scripts %} and {% term automations %} is that {% term scripts %} do not have triggers. This means that {% term scripts %} cannot automatically run unless they are used in an {% term automations %}. Scripts are particularly useful if you perform the same {% term actions %} in different {% term automations %} or trigger them from a dashboard. For information on how to create {% term scripts %}, refer to the [scripts](/integrations/script/) documentation.

## Scenes

Scenes allow you to create predefined settings for your {% term devices %}. Similar to a driving mode on phones, or driver profiles in cars, it can change an environment to suit you. For example, your *watching films* {% term scene %} may dim the lighting, switch on the TV and increase its volume. This can be saved as a {% term scene %} and used without having to set individual {% term devices %} every time.

To learn how to use {% term scenes %}, refer to the [scene](/integrations/scene/) documentation.

## Add-ons

Depending on your [installation type](/installation), you can install third party add-ons. Add-ons are usually apps that can be run with Home Assistant but provide a quick and easy way to install, configure, and run within Home Assistant. Add-ons provide additional functionality whereas {% term integrations %} connect Home Assistant to other apps.
