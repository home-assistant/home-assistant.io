## First contact with the Overview dashboard

The procedure below is optional. The idea is to learn some basics on changing the dashboard.

### To change a card on the Overview dashboard

1. To view your dashboard, go to **Overview**.
   - Your dashboard might not have much on it yet.
   - If you have smart home devices in your home, some may have been connected automatically.
   - In this example, some Bluetooth temperature sensors and an AV receiver connected automatically.
   - Some cards are there by default, such as the weather, a card for the person who set up the system, and the text-to-speech service.

2. To view the weather forecast for the next few days, select the weather card.

3. To change the units used on the card, select the cogwheel.
    - Change the units if you like.
    - Do not change any of the other settings for now.
    - Once you are done, select **Update**.

8. Finally, we want to move the weather card to the top left corner.
   - On the bottom of the card, select the number or use the minus button to enter `1`.
   - Repeat this on other cards, if you want to move them around.
   - When you are done, in the top right corner, select **Done**.
9. Congratulations! You have completed your first dashboard customization.
