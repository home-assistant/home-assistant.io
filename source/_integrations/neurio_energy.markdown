Integrate your [Neurio](https://neur.io/) meter information into Home Assistant. To get an API key and secret, login to your [Neurio account](https://my.neur.io/#settings/applications/register) and register an application. Note the Homepage URL and Callback URL are optional.

To enable this {% term integration %} in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  platform: neurio_energy
  api_key: "CLIENT_ID"
  api_secret: "CLIENT_SECRET"
  sensor_id: "SENSOR_ID"
```

Two sensors will be created with the following names:

- **Energy Usage**: Current active power usage in Watts. Updated every 10 seconds.
- **Daily Energy Usage**: Daily power usage in kWh.  Updated every 2.5 minutes.
