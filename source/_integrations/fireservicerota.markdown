FireServiceRota is a powerful and flexible availability, scheduling and dispatching system for firefighters.
It's the international brand of the Dutch [BrandweerRooster](https://www.brandweerrooster.nl), which is in use by more than 200 fire stations in The Netherlands.

The FireServiceRota integration provides you real-time information about incidents (emergency calls) from your local fire station and the ability to send a response depending on your duty schedule.

You will need a FireServiceRota or BrandweerRooster account.

<div class='note'>

A word of caution: Do not solely rely on this integration for your emergency calls!

</div>

This integration provides the following platforms:

- Sensor: Incoming emergency calls. Metadata contains _among other data_ the location of the incident and a text-to-speech URL. The integration uses a WebSocket client connection with the service to ensure a minimum delay.
- Binary sensor: Your current duty status (as scheduled via the FireServiceRota mobile app and/or website).
- Switch: Enabled for 30 minutes after an emergency call. ‘on’ represents a confirmed response. Use this to automate your emergency call response and save valuable seconds.

On how to write automations using these platform read the 'Advanced Configuration' section below.

## Entities

The following entity types are created:

### Incidents sensor

This is the main entity of the integration containing the incident message as its `value`, it has several attributes which are described below.

| Attribute               | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `trigger`               | Type of trigger, `new` or `update`.                                 |
| `state`                 | The state of the incident.                                          |
| `created_at`            | Date and time when incident was created.                            |
| `message_to_speech_url` | The URL of the mp3 file containing the spoken text of the incident. |
| `prio`                  | Priority of the incident, `a1`, `a2`, `b1` or `b2`.                 |
| `type`                  | Type of incident, e.g. `incident_alert`.                            |
| `responder_mode`        | Modes of response, e.g. `available_in_schedule_is_acknowledgment`.  |
| `can_respond_until`     | Date and time until response is accepted.                           |
| `latitude`              | The Latitude of the incident.                                       |
| `longitude`             | The Longitude of the incident.                                      |
| `address_type`          | Type of address, e.g. `home`.                                       |
| `formatted_address`     | Address in string format.                                           |
| `task_ids`              | ID(s) of appliance(s) or task(s).                                   |

### Duty binary sensor

This entity reflects the duty you have scheduled, the value can be `on` = on duty, `off` = no duty. When you have no duty the response switch is disabled which means you cannot respond to a call.

| Attribute               | Description                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `start_time`            | Start date and time of duty schedule. |
| `end_time`              | End date and time of duty schedule.   |
| `available`             | `true` or `false`.                    |
| `active`                | `true` or `false`.                    |
| `assigned_function_ids` | Function id's, e.g. `540`.            |
| `skill_ids`             | Skill id's, e.g. `6, 8`.              |
| `type`                  | Type, e.g. `standby_duty`.            |
| `assigned function`     | Assigned function, e.g. `Chauffeur`.  |

### Incident response switch

With this switch you can respond to an incident, either by manually controlling the switch via the GUI, or by using an automation action.
It gets reset to `unknown` value with every incident received. Switching it to `on` means you send a response acknowledgment, switching it back `off` sends a response rejected.

The following attributes are available:

| Attribute                        | Description                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `user_name`                      | Your username.                       |
| `assigned_skill_ids`             | Assigned skill ID's.                 |
| `responded_at`                   | Time you responded.                  |
| `start_time`                     | Incident response start time.        |
| `status`                         | Status of response, e.g., `pending`. |
| `reported_status`                | Reported status, e.g., `shown_up`.   |
| `arrived_at_station`             | `true` or `false`.                   |
| `available_at_incident_creation` | `true` or `false`.                   |
| `active_duty_function_ids`       | Active function ID's, e.g., `540`.   |

## Advanced configuration

With Automation you can configure one or more of the following useful actions:

1. Sound an alarm and/or switch on lights when an emergency incident is received.
2. Use text-to-speech to play incident details via a media player while getting dressed.
3. Respond with a response acknowledgment using a door-sensor when leaving the house or by pressing a button to let your teammates know you are underway.
4. Cast a FireServiceRota dashboard to a Chromecast device. (this requires a Nabu Casa subscription)

These are documented below.

This screenshot shows what a FireServiceRota dashboard can look like.

## Debugging

The FireServiceRota integration will log additional information about WebSocket incidents received, response and duty status gathered, and other messages when the log level is set to `debug`. Add the relevant lines below to the `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.fireservicerota: debug
    pyfireservicerota: debug
```
