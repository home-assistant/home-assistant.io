The Kitchen Sink integration contains demonstrations of various odds and ends.

This sets up a demo environment of features which are obscure or which represent incorrect behavior, and are thus not wanted in the `demo` integration.

To enable the `kitchen_sink` integration in Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

kitchen_sink:
```
