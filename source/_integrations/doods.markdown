The `doods` image processing {% term integration %} allows you to detect and recognize objects in a camera image using [DOODS](https://github.com/snowzach/doods/). The state of the entity is the number of objects detected and recognized objects are listed in the `summary` attribute along with quantity. The `matches` attribute provides the confidence `score` for recognition and the bounding `box` of the object for each detection category.

## Setup

The DOODS software needs to be running before this integration can be used. Options to run the DOODS software:

- Run as [Home Assistant add-on](https://github.com/snowzach/hassio-addons)
- Run as a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/snowzach/doods)

## Configuration

To enable this integration in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

{% endconfiguration %}

## Supported labels

Both detectors `default` and `tensorflow` use the labels in [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amikelive/coco-labels/master/coco-labels-2014_2017.txt).

## Sample configuration

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example advanced configuration.yaml entry
image_processing:
  - platform: doods
    scan_interval: 1000
    url: "http://<my doods server>:8080"
    timeout: 60
    detector: default
    auth_key: 2up3rL0ng4uthK3y
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.front_yard
    file_out:
      - "/tmp/{{ camera_entity.split('.')[1] }}_latest.jpg"
      - "/tmp/{{ camera_entity.split('.')[1] }}_{{ now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S') }}.jpg"
    confidence: 50
    # This global detection area is required for all labels
    area:
      # Exclude top 10% of image
      top: 0.1
      # Exclude right 5% of image
      right: 0.95
      # The entire detection must be inside this box
      covers: true
    labels:
      - name: person
        confidence: 40
        area:
          # Exclude top 10% of image
          top: 0.1
          # Exclude right 15% of image
          right: 0.85
          # Any part of the detection inside this area will trigger
          covers: false
      - car
      - truck
```

{% endraw %}

## Optimizing resources

The [Image processing integration](/components/image_processing/) process the image from a camera at a fixed period given by the `scan_interval`. This leads to excessive processing if the image on the camera hasn't changed, as the default `scan_interval` is 10 seconds. You can override this by adding to your configuration `scan_interval: 10000` (setting the interval to 10,000 seconds) and then call the `image_processing.scan` service when you actually want to perform processing.

```yaml
# Example advanced configuration.yaml entry
image_processing:
  - platform: doods
    scan_interval: 10000
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.driveway
      - entity_id: camera.backyard
```

```yaml
# Example advanced automations.yaml entry
- alias: "Doods scanning"
  trigger:
     - platform: state
       entity_id:
         - binary_sensor.driveway
  action:
    - service: image_processing.scan
      target:
        entity_id: image_processing.doods_camera_driveway
```
