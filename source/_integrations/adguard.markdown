AdGuard Home is a network-wide DNS server that supports ad, tracker,
and adult content blocking. The **AdGuard** integration allows you to control and
monitor your AdGuard Home instance in Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Sensors

This integration provides {% term sensors %} for the following information from AdGuard Home:

- Number of DNS queries.
- Number of blocked DNS queries.
- Ratio (%) of blocked DNS queries.
- Number of requests blocked by safe browsing.
- Number of safe searches enforced.
- Number of requests blocked by parental control.
- Total number of active filter rules loaded.
- Average response time of AdGuard's DNS server in milliseconds.

## Switches

The integration will create a number of switches:

- AdGuard Protection (master switch).
- Filtering.
- Safe Browsing.
- Parental Control.
- Safe Search.
- Query Log.

These switches allow you to automate things easily. For example, one could
write an automation to turn off Safe Search after the kids' bedtime.

The "AdGuard Protection" switch is a master switch. It will turn off and
bypass all AdGuard features, regardless of whether they are switched on or not.

<div class="note">
Turning off Query Log will result in all sensors not receiving updates anymore.
AdGuard relies on Query Log to provide stats.
</div>

## Services

These {% term services %} allow one to manage filter subscriptions in AdGuard Home.
Using these services in automations could be helpful to block certain
sites/domains at certain times.

For example, you could create a custom filter list that blocks social media sites
during the day and releases them during the evening.

throttling logic, so use with care.
