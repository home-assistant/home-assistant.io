The `sony_projector` switch platform allows you to control the state of SDCP compatible network-connected projectors from [Sony](https://www.sony.com/).

## Configuration

To use your Sony Projector in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: sony_projector
    host: "192.168.1.47"
    name: "Projector"
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The hostname or IP address of the projector.
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: The name to use when displaying this switch.
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

Under your projector's web interface **Advanced Menu**, you may need to:
- Enable/start the **PJ Talk** service.
- Add the IP of your Home Assistant server to the **Host Address** field.
