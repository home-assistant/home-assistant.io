The GitHub integration allows you to monitor your favorite [GitHub](https://github.com/) repositories.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

When you set up this integration, you will first be guided to allow the integration to use the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) on your behalf. If you do not yet have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account you will be prompted to create one during the configuration of the integration.

When you have authorized the integration, you select repositories you want to monitor, the list contains repositories you have created and [starred](https://github.com/stars) on GitHub with your account.

The integration works by subscribing to events on the repository to provide a push-like experience for the entities, which means that when a new issue is created or when someone open up a pull request with some fixes or when that new release you have been waiting for just got released this integration will help you get the information as soon as it happens.

## Remove authorization

After you have removed the integration from {% my integrations title="Settings -> Devices & Services" %}, you need to manually revoke OAuth app authorization.

1. Go to your [Authorized OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/applications)
2. Find the "Home Assistant GitHub Integration" application
3. Click the 3 dots (`...`) to the right of the name
4. Select "Revoke"

## Service

When you configure a repository to be tracked in this integration it will be represented as a service in the device panel and all entities related to the repository will be nested under that device. The device also provides a link to the repository on GitHub and an option to download [diagnostics](/integrations/diagnostics) for the service.
