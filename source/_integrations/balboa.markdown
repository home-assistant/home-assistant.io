## Known limitations

- The WiFi Module is a direct connection to the control panel of the spa. Certain combinations of settings are not possible due to limitations of the spa.
- Turning on certain pumps, depending on the spa configuration, may cause other pumps to come online as well.
- The spa WiFi Module will need to be configured initially by the phone app to authenticate and get an IP on your network.
- The WiFi Module will automatically disconnect from Home Assistant periodically, and then be automatically reconnected. The disconnect is built-in to the hardware.

## Debugging integration

If you have problems with Balboa or the integration you can add debug prints to the log.

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    pybalboa: debug
    homeassistant.components.balboa: debug
```
