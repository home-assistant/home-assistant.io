The SMA Solar integration will poll a [SMA](http://www.sma-solar.com/) [(US)](https://www.sma-america.com/) solar inverter, energy meter or battery inverter and present the values as sensors in Home Assistant.


{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Supported Devices

Not all inverters, energy meters and batteries from SMA are supported.

The integration uses the device's web interface (called webconnect). Before you start, make sure you are able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser. Devices with the ennexos operating system (like the Tripower X series) and all Energy Meters (SMA Energy Meter and SMA Sunny Home Manager) are not supported.

## Sensors

The SMA WebConnect module supports a wide variety of sensors, but not all of these have been mapped in the `pysma` library. Currently available sensors can be found below. Feel free to submit additional sensors to be added as standard sensors to the [pysma library](https://github.com/rklomp/pysma/blob/master/pysma/definitions.py).
