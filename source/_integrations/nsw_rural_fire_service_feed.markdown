The `nsw_rural_fire_service_feed` platform lets you integrate a GeoJSON feed provided by the [NSW Rural Fire Service](https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me) with information about bush fires, grass fires, hazard reductions and more. It retrieves incidents from a feed and shows information of those incidents filtered by distance to Home Assistant's location.

</p>

Entities are generated, updated and removed automatically with each update from the feed. Each entity defines latitude and longitude and will be shown on the map automatically. The distance in kilometers is available as the state of each entity.

The entity's information can be used for example if a bush fire that produces smoke or embers is reported close to your home, and you want to automatically close windows, turn on a sprinkler system or simply send yourself a reminder to clean the gutters from dry leaves.

The data is updated every 5 minutes.

## Configuration

To integrate the NSW Rural Fire Service Incidents feed, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
geo_location:
  - platform: nsw_rural_fire_service_feed
```

{% configuration %}

  description: The distance in kilometers around Home Assistant's coordinates in which incidents are included.
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 20.0
categories:

## Advanced Configuration Example

Depending on your personal circumstances with regards to bush fire risk you may want to adjust the radius and define the categories of fire warnings you are actually interested in.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
geo_location:
  - platform: nsw_rural_fire_service_feed
    entity_namespace: "nsw_fire_service_feed"
    radius: 10
    categories:
      - 'Emergency Warning'
      - 'Watch and Act'
      - 'Advice'
```
