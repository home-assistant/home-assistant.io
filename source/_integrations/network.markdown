It is managed by going to **{% my network title="Settings > System > Network" %}** and is only available to users that have "Advanced Mode" enabled on their {% my profile title="user profile" %}.

## Auto detection

Auto detection is based on the system routing next hop for the mDNS broadcast address (`224.0.0.251`).

If the next-hop has non-loopback, non-link-local, non-multicast addresses, auto detection will use the interface that corresponds to the next-hop (commonly referred to as the default interface).

If the next-hop cannot be detected or is a loopback address, auto detection will use all interfaces with non-loopback, non-link-local, non-multicast addresses. 

## Configuration

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

Add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

```
