This integration enables control of the complete [Axion Lighting](https://axionlighting.com/) ecosystem via the Axion PoE & Wi-Fi DMX Controller. Using Home Assistant you can add White, Tunable White, RGB, RGBW, and RGBWW lighting loads. The module provides accurate brightness scaling, quick responsiveness, and is easy to integrate any DMX address from 1-512.

## Prerequisites

To use this integration, you will need an Axion Lighting system that supports DMX control. Ensure that your DMX controller is properly connected to your Home Assistant instance.

### Configuration Options

When setting up the Axion Lighting integration, you can configure the following options:

| Parameter               | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip_address`            | The IP address of the DMX controller. |
| `password`              | The password required to access the DMX controller. |
| `dmx_channel`           | The starting DMX channel for the light entity. The channels are numbered starting from 1. |
| `light_type`            | The type of light entity to control (e.g., White, Tunable White, RGB, RGBW, RGBWW). |

## Light Entities

This integration supports the following light entities:

- **White**: Controls the brightness of a single white channel.
- **Tunable White**: Controls the temperature of white light by adjusting the balance between warm and cool white channels.
- **RGB**: Controls Red, Green, and Blue channels with brightness scaling.
- **RGBW**: Controls Red, Green, Blue, and White channels with brightness scaling.
- **RGBWW**: Controls Red, Green, Blue, Warm White, and Cold White channels with brightness scaling.

### Usage

Once configured, your Axion Lighting devices will appear in Home Assistant, and you can control the lights using the UI. The integration supports standard Home Assistant light services, such as turning lights on/off, adjusting brightness, and changing colors (for RGB, RGBW, and RGBWW modes).
