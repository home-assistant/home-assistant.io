The `raspyrfm` {% term integration %} adds support for cheap RC 433 MHz outlets via one of the supported gateways.

Initially, this integration was created to support the Simple Solutions `ConnAir` gateway which has been discontinued. There are custom alternatives that reimplemented the protocol used by the ConnAir gateway like this [ConnAir emulator](https://github.com/Phunkafizer/RaspyRFM#connairpy) which can be used in conjunction with the [RaspyRFM-II](https://www.seegel-systeme.de/produkt/raspyrfm-ii) RC module for a Raspberry Pi.

Other vendors of 433 MHz RC outlets have also created gateways that use a very similar protocol and can also be used with this integration like the Intertechno [ITGW-433 LAN Gateway](https://www.intertechno24.de/LAN-Gateway/Gateway-ITGW-433.html).

## Configuration

To use the RaspyRFM {% term integration %} in your installation, add it to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: raspyrfm
  switches:
    - controlunit_manufacturer: Intertechno
      controlunit_model: CMR 1000
      channel_config:  # Note that keys used here vary between control units
        master: A
        slave: 1
```

{% configuration %}

      type: string

      description: Model of the control unit.
      required: true

    channel_config:
      description: Channel configuration of the control unit. The exact keys needed depend on the control unit manufacturer and model.
      required: true
      type: map
{% endconfiguration %}

## Device support

Have a look at the underlying library [raspyrfm-client](https://github.com/markusressel/raspyrfm-client) to check what gateways and control units (outlets) are supported.

## Channel configuration

Depending on the control unit the channel configuration can have varying formats. Have a look at the underlying library [raspyrfm-client](https://github.com/markusressel/raspyrfm-client) to find out about a specific model.

## Switch state

Initially, the state of a switch is unknown. When the switch is turned on or off (via frontend) the state is known and will be shown in the frontend.

{% note %}
Note that due to the way those cheap RC units work it is **not possible to query their current state**. Therefore the only way to preserve a consistent state within Home Assistant is to only use Home Assistant as the controller.

        slave: 1
    - name: My other Switch
