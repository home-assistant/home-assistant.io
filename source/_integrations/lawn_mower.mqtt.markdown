The `mqtt` `lawn_mower` platform allows controlling a lawn mower over MQTT.

## Configuration

To enable MQTT lawn mower in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - lawn_mower:
      command_topic: topic
      name: "Test Lawn Mower"
```

{% configuration %}
activity_state_topic:
  description: The MQTT topic subscribed to receive an update of the activity. Valid activities are `mowing`, `paused`, `docked`, and `error`. Use `value_template` to extract the activity state from a custom payload. When payload `none` is received, the activity state will be reset to `unknown`.  
  required: false

If set to `any`, `payload_available` must be received on at least one configured availability topic before the entity is marked as online. If set to `latest`, the last `payload_available` or `payload_not_available` received on any configured availability topic controls the availability.

{% important %}
Make sure that your topic matches exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

## Example

The example below shows how to use a single command topic with a command template.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - lawn_mower:
      name: "Lawn Mower Plus"
      activity_state_topic: "lawn_mower_plus/state"
      activity_value_template: "{{ value_json.activity }}" 
      pause_command_topic: "lawn_mower_plus/set"
      pause_command_template: '{"activity": "{{ value }}"}' 
      dock_command_topic: "lawn_mower_plus/set"
      dock_command_template: '{"activity": "{{ value }}"}' 
      start_mowing_command_topic: "lawn_mower_plus/set"
      start_mowing_command_template: '{"activity": "{{ value }}"}' 
```

{% endraw %}
