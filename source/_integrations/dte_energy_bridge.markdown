A sensor {% term integration %} for [DTE](https://www.newlook.dteenergy.com/) using an early model of the Energy Bridge. To find out which version of the DTE Energy Bridge you have, find the status LED on your box.

 - If the status LED is on the top, you have a v1.
 - If the status LED is on the front, you have a v2.

<div class='note'>

The firmware of the DTE v2 bridges that started shipping circa mid-2020 will not work with this integration. This includes the model containing integrated Wi-Fi.

You can check if your firmware is still supported by trying accessing `http://{ip_address}:8888/zigbee/se/instantaneousdemand`, and see if
you get a response.

Later model DTE Energy Bridge hardware uses [MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) to communicate your energy data with Home Assistant.

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
