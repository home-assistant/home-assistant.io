The `aquostv` platform allows you to control a [Sharp Aquos TV](https://global.sharp/aquos/index.html).

When the TV is first connected, you will need to accept Home Assistant on the TV to allow communication.

## Configuration

To add a TV to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: aquostv
    host: 192.168.0.10
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: true
  type: string

power_on_enabled:

  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>

When you set **power_on_enabled** as True, you have to turn on your TV on the first time with the remote.
Then you will be able to turn on with Home Assistant.
Also, with **power_on_enabled** as True, the Aquos logo on your TV will stay on when you turn off the TV and your TV could consume more power.
