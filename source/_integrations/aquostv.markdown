The `aquostv` platform allows you to control a [Sharp Aquos TV](http://www.sharp-world.com/aquos/en/index.html).

When the TV is first connected, you will need to accept Home Assistant on the TV to allow communication.

To add a TV to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: aquostv
    host: 192.168.0.10
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP/Hostname of the Sharp Aquos TV, e.g., `192.168.0.10`.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port of the Sharp Aquos TV.
  required: false
  default: 10002
  type: integer
username:
  description: The username of the Sharp Aquos TV.
  required: false
  default: admin
  type: string
password:
  description: The password of the Sharp Aquos TV.
  required: false
  default: password
  type: string
name:
  description: The name you would like to give to the Sharp Aquos TV.
  required: false
  type: string
power_on_enabled:
  description: If you want to be able to turn on your TV.
  required: false
  default: false
  type: boolean
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>

When you set **power_on_enabled** as True, you have to turn on your TV on the first time with the remote.
Then you will be able to turn on with Home Assistant.
Also, with **power_on_enabled** as True, the Aquos logo on your TV will stay on when you turn off the TV and your TV could consume more power.
