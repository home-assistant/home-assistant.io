The `foscam` platform allows you to watch the live stream of your [Foscam](https://www.foscam.com) IP camera in Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% note %}
There seems to be some issues within Foscam with lengthy passwords and passwords containing certain symbols. Be sure to check your camera's documentation.

### Streams

Most Foscam IP Cameras supports two video streams, by default the `Main` stream is the high quality stream while the `Sub` stream is a lower quality stream. These streams can be configured in your camera preferences.

### Service `foscam.ptz`

If your Foscam camera supports <abbr title="pan, tilt, and zoom">PTZ</abbr>, you will be able to pan or tilt your camera.

| Service data attribute | Description |
| -----------------------| ----------- |
| `entity_id` | String or list of strings that point at `entity_id`s of cameras. Use `entity_id: all` to target all. |
| `movement` | 	Direction of the movement. Allowed values: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `top_left`, `top_right`, `bottom_left`, `bottom_right` |
| `travel_time` | (Optional) Travel time in seconds. Allowed values: float from 0 to 1. Default: 0.125 |

### Service `foscam.ptz_preset`

If your Foscam camera supports <abbr title="pan, tilt, and zoom">PTZ</abbr> presets, you will be able to move the camera to a predefined preset using the preset name.

| Service data attribute | Description |
| -----------------------| ----------- |
| `entity_id` | String or list of strings that point at `entity_id`s of cameras. Use `entity_id: all` to target all. |
| `preset_name` | The name of the preset to move to. Presets can be created from within the official Foscam apps. |

Using the following card code you can achieve a card displaying the live video feed from a Foscam camera with controls for moving the camera at the bottom right corner.
