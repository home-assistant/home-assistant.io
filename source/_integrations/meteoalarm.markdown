The `MeteoAlarm` platform allows one to watch for weather alerts in Europe from [MeteoAlarm](https://www.meteoalarm.org) (EUMETNET). To use this binary sensor, you need the country and the province name from  [MeteoAlarm](https://feeds.meteoalarm.org). Please note that it is crucial to write the country name exactly as it appears in the URL starting with https://feeds.meteoalarm.org/feeds/meteoalarm-legacy-atom-, including any hyphens used in the name. Failure to do so may result in errors or incorrect data.

The binary sensor state shows the warning message if applicable. The details are available as attribute.

## Configuration

To enable this binary sensor, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}:

```yaml

  - platform: meteoalarm

```
