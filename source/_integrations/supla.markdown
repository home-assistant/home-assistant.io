The SUPLA integration allows you to use [SUPLA](https://supla.org/) devices in Home Assistant.

SUPLA-DEV is an open source home automation system for Raspberry Pi, Arduino or ESP8266-based devices. It has its own protocols, firmware and commercially available devices, such as those produced by [Zamel](https://supla.zamel.com/en/).

Currently, only covers (shutters in SUPLA's terminology), gates, garage doors, and switches are supported, but thanks to comprehensive and universal REST API, it's pretty easy to add more.

Right now, it's impossible to add a device -- all of them are discovered from SUPLA-CLOUD's servers or yours.

For more complete Home Assistant support based on MQTT autodiscovery, consider switching your Supla devices to MQTT (through the setup interface). Or use the MQTT broker provided by [Supla Cloud](https://cloud.supla.org/integrations/mqtt-broker).

## Configuration

To use SUPLA devices in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
supla:
  servers:
    - server: "svr1.supla.org"
      access_token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

{% configuration %}
