## Sensor

The `whirlpool` sensor platform integrates Whirlpool Washer and Dryer systems into Home Assistant, allowing views of the machine state, time remaining and the "wash & go" tank fill status as sensors for each device.

## Climate

The `whirlpool` climate platform integrates Whirlpool air conditioning systems into Home Assistant, allowing control of the appliance trough the user interface. The current inside temperature is also displayed on the thermostat card.

The following services are also available:

- [**set_hvac_mode**](/integrations/climate/#service-climateset_hvac_mode) (`off`, `heat`, `cool`, `fan_only`)
- [**target temperature**](/integrations/climate#service-climateset_temperature)
- [**turn on/off**](/integrations/climate#service-climateturn_on)
- [**fan mode**](/integrations/climate#service-climateset_fan_mode) (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
- [**swing mode**](/integrations/climate#service-climateset_swing_mode) (`off`, `horizontal`)
