Integrates Airthings BLE {% term sensors %} into Home Assistant.

[Airthings](https://www.airthings.com/) provide different {% term devices %} for measuring the air quality. Initially focusing on radon gas sensors, each device provides a number of different sensors to monitor typical contaminants that's presence contributes to bad air quality in the home.

Requires Airthings hardware and a compatible Bluetooth dongle.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The Airthings BLE integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional. This will include the device name and its serial number.

There are two ways of retrieving the 10-digit serial number of a Wave device:
1. At the back of the device, located under the magnetic backplate.
2. Airthings app: **Device settings -> Device info -> Serial Number**

This integration uses the last 6 digits of the serial number.
