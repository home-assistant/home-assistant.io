With the `route53` {% term integration %} can you keep your AWS Route53 DNS records up to date.

The integration will run every hour, but can also be started manually by using the service `route53.update_records` under services.

Please note that this platform uses the API from [ipify.org](https://www.ipify.org/) to set the public IP address.

## Setup

You will need to configure your AWS Account with a suitable IAM policy and API keys for this to function.

If you are familiar with this process, you can skip the next section and head directly to the configuration section.

On the AWS side, you need to do the following;

1. Create a suitable zone for a domain that you own and manage in Route53, the domain `home.yourdomain.com` is used as an example.

2. Once created, write down the Hosted Zone ID value for the domain. This is needed for the plugin and IAM configuration.

3. Create an IAM Policy that provides update and query access to this domain explicitly and has no other permissions to the AWS account.

Here is an IAM Policy sample, don't forget to update your Zone ID on the Resource line.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:GetHostedZone",
                "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
                "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/YOURZONEIDGOESHERE"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "route53:TestDNSAnswer",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Once this has been done, create a new user called `homeassistant` and add the IAM policy to the user, allowing it to manage this DNS resource.

5. Under the security credentials tab for the `homeassistant` user, create a set of access keys for placement in the integration definition YAML.

## Configuration

To use the {% term integration %} in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

  aws_access_key_id: ABC123

    - vpn
    - hassio
    - home
```
