The schedule integration provides a way to create a weekly schedule in
Home Assistant that can be used to trigger or make decisions in your
automations and scripts.

The preferred way to configure a schedule is via the user interface at
**{% my helpers title="Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers." %}** Click the add button
and then choose the **{% my config_flow_start domain=schedule title="Schedule" %}** option, or click the My button below.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

To be able to add **{% my helpers title="Helpers" %}** via the user interface you should
have `default_config:` in your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}, it should already
be there by default unless you removed it.

If you removed `default_config:` from your configuration,
you must add it back or, alternatively, `schedule:` to your
`configuration.yaml` first, before you can create them via the UI.

Alternatively, a schedule can also be created and configured via YAML
configuration. For example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
schedule:
  thermostat_schedule:
    name: "Thermostat schedule"
    monday:
      - from: "17:00:00"
        to: "21:00:00"
    tuesday:
      - from: "17:00:00"
        to: "21:00:00"
    wednesday:
      - from: "17:00:00"
        to: "21:00:00"
    thursday:
      - from: "17:00:00"
        to: "21:00:00"
    friday:
      - from: "17:00:00"
        to: "23:00:00"
    saturday:
      - from: "07:00:00"
        to: "10:00:00"
      - from: "16:00:00"
        to: "23:00:00"
    sunday:
      - from: "07:00:00"
        to: "21:00:00"
```

          required: true
          type: time
        to:
          description: The end time to mark as inactive/off again.
          required: true

{% endconfiguration %}

### Attributes

A schedule entity's state exports attributes that can be useful in
automations and templates.

| Attribute | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `next_event` | A datetime object containing the next time the schedule is going to change state. |

### Automation example

A schedule creates an on/off (schedule) sensor within the times set. Using the thermostat schedule example above, you can turn on your thermostat:

```yaml
trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id:
        - schedule.thermostat_schedule
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: climate.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: climate.thermostat
```

### Services

Available service: `schedule.reload`.

#### schedule.reload

`schedule.reload` service allows one to reload the schedule's configuration without restarting Home Assistant itself.
