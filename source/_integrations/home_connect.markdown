The Home Connect integration allows users to integrate their home appliances supporting the Home Connect standard for Bosch and Siemens using the [official cloud API](https://developer.home-connect.com).

The integration will add one Home Assistant device for each connected home appliance which will have the following entities:

- A power switch
- If the device has programs, switches for each of the individual programs will be added. Note that program options cannot be configured currently.
- If the device has programs, a timestamp sensor for remaining time and a numeric sensor for the progress percentage.
- For hood's functional light a light switch including brightness control will be added.
- For hood's and dishwasher's ambient light a light switch including brightness and color control will be added.

Note that it depends on the appliance and on API permissions which of the features are supported.

## Prerequisites

1. Visit [https://developer.home-connect.com](https://developer.home-connect.com) and sign up for a developer account.
2. Enter the email of your login for the original Home Connect App from Bosch/Siemens under "Default Home Connect User Account for Testing" in the sign up process.
3. Under [Applications](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications), register a new App:

- Application ID: Home Assistant (or whatever name makes sense to you)
- OAuth Flow: Authorization Code Grant Flow
- Redirect URI: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`

*Important*:
 - **Power on** all your appliances during the integration configuration process; otherwise appliance programs list will be empty.
 - To update the appliance programs list, you can reload the Home Connect integration when an appliance is turned on. If the re-initialization process is not triggered by reload, restart the Home Assistant when an appliance is turned on. 
 - After performing the steps above **log out** of your Home Connect Developer account. If you don't do this, the configuration steps below will fail during OAuth authentication with the message `“error”: “unauthorized_client”`.
 - The provided Home Connect User Account email address **must** be all lowercase otherwise it will result in authentication failures.
 - All changes in the developer portal take 15 minutes before the change is implemented.

{% details "I have manually disabled My Home Assistant" %}

If you don't have [My Home Assistant](/integrations/my) on your installation,
you can use `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>/auth/external/callback` as the redirect URI
instead.

The `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>` must be the same as used during the configuration/
authentication process.

Internal examples: `http://192.168.0.2:8123/auth/external/callback`, `http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/external/callback`." 

{% enddetails %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The integration configuration will ask for the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* created above. See [Application Credentials](/integrations/application_credentials) for more details.
