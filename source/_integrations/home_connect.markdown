The Home Connect integration allows users to integrate their home appliances supporting the Home Connect standard for Bosch and Siemens using the [official cloud API](https://developer.home-connect.com).

The integration will add one Home Assistant device for each connected home appliance which will have the following entities:

- A power switch
- If the device has programs, switches for each of the individual programs will be added. Note that program options cannot be configured currently.
- If the device has programs, a timestamp sensor for remaining time and a numeric sensor for the progress percentage.
- For hood's functional light a light switch including brightness control will be added.
- For hood's and dishwasher's ambient light a light switch including brightness and color control will be added.

Note that it depends on the appliance and on API permissions which of the features are supported.

## Prerequisites

1. Visit [https://developer.home-connect.com](https://developer.home-connect.com) and sign up for a developer account.
2. Enter the email of your login for the original Home Connect App from Bosch/Siemens under "Default Home Connect User Account for Testing" in the sign up process.
3. Go to the [Applications](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications) page and select [Register Application](https://developer.home-connect.com/application/add):

- Application ID: Home Assistant (or whatever name makes sense to you)
- OAuth Flow: Authorization Code Grant Flow
- Redirect URI: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
- Go to `https://my.home-assistant.io/` and make sure that your Home Assistant URL is set there. For example: `http://homeassistant:8123/` or `http://homeassistant.local:8123`

4. On success, you will be redirected to the **Applications** page. Select **Details** for your app. Make note of the client ID and secret - you will need it for the next step. Log out of the Home Connect developer portal.
5. In Home Assistant, find the Home Connect integration and launch it. You will be prompted to create an [Application Credential](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/application_credentials). You will need to provide a name (it's arbitrary) in addition to the Client ID and Secret from the previous step. Then, follow the steps in the UI to complete setup.

*Important*:
 - **Power on** all your appliances during the integration configuration process; otherwise appliance programs list will be empty.
 - To update the appliance programs list, you can reload the Home Connect integration when an appliance is turned on. If the re-initialization process is not triggered by reload, restart the Home Assistant when an appliance is turned on. 
 - After performing the steps above, [log out](https://developer.home-connect.com/user/logout) of your Home Connect Developer account. If you don't do this, the configuration steps below will fail during OAuth authentication with the message `“error”: “unauthorized_client”`.
 - The provided Home Connect User Account email address **must** be all lowercase otherwise it will result in authentication failures.
 - All changes in the developer portal take 15 minutes before the change is implemented.

{% details "I have manually disabled My Home Assistant" %}

If you don't have [My Home Assistant](/integrations/my) on your installation,
you can use `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>/auth/external/callback` as the redirect URI
instead.

The `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>` must be the same as used during the configuration/
authentication process.

Internal examples: `http://192.168.0.2:8123/auth/external/callback`, `http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/external/callback`." 

{% enddetails %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The integration configuration will ask for the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* created above. See [Application Credentials](/integrations/application_credentials) for more details.
