The `dominos` integration allows you to order Dominos Pizza from within your Home Assistant scripts and automations.

At present, this integration only supports ordering within Canada and the US.

## Configuration

To enable the component, you need to set up your customer information and define some orders.

Orders are a group of product codes. You can get these product codes by inspecting an order request from the Dominos web app, or you can [add this custom panel by following this readme](https://github.com/craigjmidwinter/hass-dominos-panel) to see the available product codes in a separate panel in your install.

Currently, there is no support in this integration for toppings, coupons or order tracking.

```yaml
dominos:
  country_code: ca
  first_name: John
  last_name: Smith
  email: john.smith@example.com
  phone: 123456789
  address: 24 Housten Dr, Ottawa, ON, K2M2M2
  orders:
  - name: Medium Pan
    codes:
      - P12IPAZA
```

Now you can use the Dominos service to order pizza within your automations:

```yaml
- service: dominos.order
  data:
    order_entity_id: dominos.medium_pan
```
