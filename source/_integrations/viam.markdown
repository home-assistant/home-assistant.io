The Viam integration allows you to turn your smart home into a smart machine! Use images and data from your Home Assistant setup to train custom machine learning models that run on device as part of your automation workflow.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this integration, you will need a [Viam account](https://www.viam.com/) and [a device with `viam-server` installed](https://docs.viam.com/installation/).

For authentication, you can use an [organization API key](https://docs.viam.com/manage/cli/#create-an-organization-api-key) or [robot address and location secret](https://docs.viam.com/manage/fleet/#control-with-the-sdks).

To use the classification and detection services, you will need a configured [vision service](https://docs.viam.com/services/vision/) for the integration.
