{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% note %}
The configuration in the UI asks for a username. Starting from FRITZ!OS 7.24 the FRITZ!Box creates a random username for the admin user if you didn't set one yourself. This can be found after logging into the FRITZ!Box and visiting System -> FRITZ!Box Users -> Users. The username starts with "fritz" followed by four random numbers. Under properties on the right it says "created automatically". Prior to FRITZ!OS 7.24 the default username was "admin".
