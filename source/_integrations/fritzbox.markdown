The AVM FRITZ!SmartHome integration for Home Assistant allows you to integrate [AVM Smart Home](https://en.avm.de/products/smart-home/) (_former AVM FRITZ!DECT_) devices like plugs, thermostats, shutter drivers or sensors as also trigger so called templates (_contains settings for Smart Home devices of the same type_).

#### Tested devices

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% note %}
The configuration in the UI asks for a username. Starting from FRITZ!OS 7.24 the FRITZ!Box creates a random username for the admin user if you didn't set one yourself. This can be found after logging into the FRITZ!Box and visiting System -> FRITZ!Box Users -> Users. The username starts with "fritz" followed by four random numbers. Under properties on the right it says "created automatically". Prior to FRITZ!OS 7.24 the default username was "admin".
{% endnote %}

## Light

Light bulbs like the [FRITZ!DECT 500][fritzdect_500] or [Magenta SmartHome LED E27 Color][magenta_led_e27_color] will be integrated as light entities.

{% note %}
The FRITZ!DECT 500 lightbulb supports only 36 colors. When a color is picked in Home Assistant that is not supported by the device, a color that comes close will be activated.
{% endnote %}

## Plugs

Plugs like the [FRITZ!DECT 200][fritzdect_200] or [FRITZ!DECT 210][fritzdect_210] will be integrated as switch entities.

Further there are additional sensor and binary sensor entities created for each device, based on its capabilities:

- Button lock via UI
- Button lock on device
- Electric Current
- Power Consumption
- Temperature
- Total Energy
- Voltage

## Shutter drivers

Shutter drivers like the [Rademacher RolloTron DECT 1213][rademacher_rollotron_dect_1213] will be integrated as cover entities.

## Templates

Self defined templates within the FRITZ!Box smart home configuration menu, will be integrated as button entities and those can be triggered from within Home Assistant.

## Thermostats

Thermostats like the [FRITZ!DECT 301][fritzdect_301], [FRITZ!DECT 302][fritzdect_302] or [Eurotronic Comet DECT][eurotronic_comet_dect] will be integrated as climate entities.

These entities can have several attributes that can be useful for automations and templates:

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `battery_low` | The low battery state indication. |
| `battery_level` | The battery level (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |
| `holiday_mode` | The state of the holiday mode (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |
| `summer_mode` | The state of the summer mode (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |
| `window_open` | The state of the window open detection (only available since Fritz!OS 7). |

Further there are additional sensor and binary sensor entities created for each device, based on its capabilities:

- Battery
- Button lock via UI
- Button lock on device
- Comfort Temperature
- Current Scheduled Preset
- Eco Temperature
- Next Scheduled Change Time
- Next Scheduled Preset
- Next Scheduled Temperature

## Sensors

Some devices like the [FRITZ!DECT 440][fritzdect_440] can't be controlled via this integration, but its sensors can still be integrated.

The availability of these sensor and binary sensor entities depends on the features and capabilities of the connected FRITZ!DECT devices and can be one or multiple of:

- Battery
- Button lock via UI
- Button lock on device
- Humidity
- Temperature
