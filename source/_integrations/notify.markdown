The **Notify** {% term integration %} makes it possible to send notifications to a wide variety of platforms. To use it, you have to set up at least one notification target (notifier). Check the [integrations list](/integrations/#notifications) for one that fits your use case.

If you want to send notifications to the Home Assistant web interface, you may use the [Persistent Notification integration](/integrations/persistent_notification/). It is available as an automatically configured notifier. See [its documentation](/integrations/persistent_notification/) for more details.

## The state of a notify entity

The state of a notify entity is the date and time when a message was last sent.

</p>

In addition, the entity can have the following states:

- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.

## Action

The legacy `notify` platform will expose a generic `notify` action that can be called to send notifications.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`      | no       | Body of the notification.                                                                                                  |
| `title`        | yes      | Title of the notification.                                                                                                 |
| `target`       | yes      | Some platforms allow specifying a recipient that will receive the notification. See your platform page if it is supported. |
| `data`         | yes      | On platforms who have extended functionality. See your platform page if it is supported.                                   |

## Usage

The different **Notify** integrations you have set up will each show up as a different automation {% term action %} that you can use.

One notification integration is automatically included, the Persistent Notifications which creates a notification in the sidebar of the web interface of Home Assistant. This can be chosen with the action named "Notifications: Send a persistent notification" which uses the `notify.persistent_notification` action.

## Notify action

Integrations can also implement the notify entity platform. Entity platform implementations will replace the legacy notify action in time. There is an entity platform action `send_message` which allows you to send notification messages to multiple notify entities.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| `message`      | no       | Body of the notification.  |
| `title`        | yes      | Title of the notification. |

## Companion app notifications

A common notification integration is via the Home Assistant Companion app for Android or iPhone. This can be chosen with the action "Send a notification via mobile_app_your_phone_name", which uses the `notify.mobile_app_your_phone_name` action. Refer to the [Companion app documentation](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/notifications/notifications-basic) for lots of customization options.

With any of these integrations, the `message` data input in the automation editor is the main text that will be sent. Other fields are optional, and some integrations support additional `data` or `target` information to customize the action. For more details, refer to their integration documentation.

Be aware that the `notify.notify` action is shorthand for the first notify action the system can find. It might not work as intended. Choose a specific action to make sure your message goes to the right place.

Notifications can also be sent using [Notify groups](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/group/#notify-groups). These allow you to send notification to multiple devices with a single call, or to update which device is notified by only changing it in a single place.

### Test if it works

After you setup a [notifier](/integrations/#notifications), a simple way to test if you have set up your notify platform correctly is to open {% my developer_services title="**Developer tools** > **Actions**" %}** tab from the sidebar. Choose your action from the **Action** dropdown menu depending on the integration you want to test, such as **Notifications: Send a persistent notification** or **Notifications: Send a notification via mobile_app_your_phone_name**. Enter your message into the **message** field, and select the **Perform action** button.

To test the entity platform action, select the `notify.send_message` action, and select one or more of `entity`, `device`, `area`, or `label`. Then, supply a `message`.

### Example with the entity platform notify action

Under {% my developer_services title="**Developer Tools** > **Actions**" %}, select the **Notifications: Send a notification message** action. Select some target entity's using the entity selectors, enter a message and test sending it.

If you switch to view the YAML data under **Developer Tools**, it will appear as below. The same {% term action %} can be chosen in {% term automation %}. The YAML will appear the same:

{% raw %}

```yaml
action: notify.send_message
data:
  entity_id: notify.my_direct_message_notifier
  message: "You have an update!"
  title: "Status changed"
```

{% endraw %}

The notify integration supports specifying [templates](/docs/configuration/templating/). This will allow you to use the current state of entities in Home Assistant in your notifications, or use more complex logic to decide the message that is sent.

{% raw %}

```yaml
action:
  action: notify.send_message
  data:
    entity_id: notify.my_direct_message_notifier
    message: "You have {{ states('todo.shopping_list') }} items on your shopping list."
```

{% endraw %}

### Examples with the legacy notify action

In the **Developer Tools**, on the **Action** tab, select the **Notifications: Send a persistent notification** action. Enter a message and test sending it.

If you switch to view the YAML data under **Developer Tools**, it will appear as below. The same {% term action %} can be chosen in {% term automation %} actions %, whose YAML will appear the same:

{% raw %}

```yaml
action: notify.persistent_notification
data:
  message: "Can you hear me now?"
```

{% endraw %}

The notify integration supports specifying [templates](/docs/configuration/templating/). This will allow you to use the current state of entities in Home Assistant in your notifications, or use more complex logic to decide the message that is sent.

{% raw %}

```yaml
action:
  action: notify.persistent_notification
  data:
    message: "You have {{ states('todo.shopping_list') }} items on your shopping list."
```

{% endraw %}

{% raw %}

```yaml
action:
  action: notify.persistent_notification
  data:
    message: "The sun is {% if is_state('sun.sun', 'above_horizon') %}up{% else %}down{% endif %}!"
```

{% endraw %}
