The `xiaomi` platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a [Xiaomi](http://miwifi.com) router.

## Setup

To use an Xiaomi router in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: xiaomi
    host: YOUR_ROUTER_IP
    password: YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "The IP address of your router, e.g., `192.168.0.1`."
  required: true
  type: string
username:
  description: The admin username.
  required: false
  default: admin
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for the admin account.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.

### Compatibility test

To ensure that your router is compatible, navigate to `http://YOUR_ROUTER_IP/api/misystem/devicelist`.
You should see a listing of the device currently connected to your router.

However, some users report that even when the previous URL does not work, they have been able to integrate their Mi Router 3 in Home Assistant. E.g., some users with the Mi Router 3 and firmware version 2.10.46 Stable have integrated their routers successfully and an alternative URL to test integration with is `http://YOUR_ROUTER_IP/cgi-bin/luci/api/misystem/devicelist`. Navigating to this page should show the `{"code":401,"msg":"Invalid token"}` message.
