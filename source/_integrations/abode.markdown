The **Abode** {% term integration %} allows you to integrate your Abode Home Security systems into Home Assistant and use its alarm system and sensors to trigger automations.

Please visit the [Abode website](https://goabode.com/) for further information about Abode Security.

There is currently support for the following {% term device %} types within Home Assistant:

- **Alarm control panel**: Reports on the current alarm status and can be used to arm and disarm the system.
- **Binary sensor**: Reports on `Quick Actions`, `Door Contacts`, `Connectivity` {% term sensors %} (remotes, keypads, and status indicators), `Moisture` sensors, and `Motion` or `Occupancy` sensors.
- **Camera**: Reports on `Camera` devices and will download and show the latest captured still image. Can be turned off and on using the [`camera.turn_off`](/integrations/camera/#service-turn_off) and [`camera.turn_on`](/integrations/camera/#service-turn_on) {% term services %}.
- **Cover**: Reports on `Secure Barriers` and can be used to open and close the cover.
- **Lock**: Reports on `Door Locks` and can be used to lock and unlock the door.
- **Light**: Reports on `Dimmer` lights and can be used to dim or turn the light on and off.
- **Switch**: Reports on `Power Switch` and `Water Valve` devices which can be turned on and off. Also reports on `Automations` set up in the Abode system and allows you to activate or deactivate them.
- **Sensor**: Reports on `Temperature`, `Humidity`, and `Light` sensors.
