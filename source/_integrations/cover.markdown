Home Assistant can give you an interface to control covers such as rollershutters, blinds, and garage doors.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

## Device class

The way these {% term sensors %} are displayed in the {% term frontend %} can be modified in the [customize section](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/). The following device classes are supported for covers:

- **None**: Generic cover. This is the default and doesn't need to be set.
- **awning**: Control of an awning, such as an exterior retractable window, door, or patio cover.
- **blind**: Control of blinds, which are linked slats that expand or collapse to cover an opening or may be tilted to partially covering an opening, such as window blinds.
- **curtain**: Control of curtains or drapes, which is often fabric hung above a window or door that can be drawn open.
- **damper**: Control of a mechanical damper that reduces airflow, sound, or light.
- **door**: Control of a door or gate that provides access to an area.
- **garage**: Control of a garage door that provides access to a garage.
- **gate**: Control of a gate. Gates are found outside of a structure and are typically part of a fence.
- **shade**: Control of shades, which are a continuous plane of material or connected cells that expanded or collapsed over an opening, such as window shades.
- **shutter**: Control of shutters, which are linked slats that swing out/in to covering an opening or may be tilted to partially cover an opening, such as indoor or exterior window shutters.
- **window**: Control of a physical window that opens and closes or may tilt.

Here are a few examples of this representation in the UI:
