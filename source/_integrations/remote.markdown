Keeps track which remotes are in your environment, their state and allows you to control them.

- Maintains a state per remote and a combined state `all_remotes`.
- Registers services `remote/turn_on`, `remote/turn_off`, `remote/toggle`, and `remote/send_command` to control remotes.

### Use the services

Go to the **Developer Tools**, then to **Call Service** in the frontend, and choose `remote/turn_on`, `remote/turn_off`, or `remote/toggle` from the list of available services (**Available services:** on the left). Enter something like the sample below into the **Service Data** field and hit **Call Service**.

```json
{"entity_id":"remote.family_room"}
```

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | yes      | Only act on a specific remote, else target all. |

See the platform documentation for each type of remote for more detailed examples.
