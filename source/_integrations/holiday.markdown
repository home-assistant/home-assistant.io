The Holiday integration allows you to create a calendar of holidays in Home Assistant for powering automations.

It uses the Python module [holidays](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/) to incorporate information about region-specific public holidays.

A calendar entity has a state and attributes that represent the next upcoming event (only). A calendar trigger is a much more flexible way to power automations with fewer limitations than using the entity state.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Holiday calendar automations

Individual holiday *Events* are what powers automations such as:

- Turn on the Christmas lights at the *start* of Christmas Day.
- Prevent your covers from being opened on public holidays.

For an overview, refer to [calendar automations](/integrations/calendar#automation). You can use [calendar trigger variables](/docs/automation/templating/#calendar) in a condition or action such as the event `summary`, `description`, `location` and in other places.
