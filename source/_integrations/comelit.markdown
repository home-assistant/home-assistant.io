The Comelit SimpleHome integration allows you to control your [Comelit home automation devices](https://comelitgroup.it/installatore/offerta/domotica-e-smart-home).

There is support for the following platform types within Home Assistant:

- **Comelit Serial Bridge** - allows local control for light, cover, irrigation, climate, humidifier/dehumidifier and "other" devices; creates power sensors.
- **Comelit VEDO System** - allows local control of the alarm system.

## Alarm control panel

The integration will create an alarm entity for each area and a sensor for each zone.
