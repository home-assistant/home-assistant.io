##### Overlay

Interrupts currently playing media to play an audio message.

To use the Bang & Olufsen Cloud TTS, use `overlay_tts` as the `media_content_type` and enter a message into the `media_content_id` field.
Bang & Olufsen Cloud TTS messages are limited to 100 unique messages a day and are cached for 24 hours.

Extra keys available:

| Service data attribute    | Optional | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `overlay_absolute_volume` | yes      | Specify an absolute volume for the overlay.                                                       |
| `overlay_offset_volume`   | yes      | Specify a volume offset to be added to the current volume level.                                  |
| `overlay_tts_language`    | yes      | Specify the language used for text-to-speech. Uses the BCP 47 standard. Default value is "en-us". |

###### Examples:

Playing a local file with an absolute volume as an overlay:

```yaml
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: music
  media_content_id: media-source://media_source/local/doorbell.mp3
  announce: true
  extra:
    overlay_absolute_volume: 60
```

Playing a Bang & Olufsen Cloud TTS message with an offset volume (as TTS messages can be quiet):

```yaml
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: overlay_tts
  media_content_id: This is a test
  announce: true
  extra:
    overlay_offset_volume: 10
```

Playing a Bang & Olufsen Cloud TTS message with a local language:
```yaml
service: media_player.play_media

  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: overlay_tts
  media_content_id: Dette er en test
  announce: true
  extra:
    overlay_tts_language: da-dk
```

## Automations

WebSocket notifications received from the device are fired as events in Home Assistant. These can be received by listening to `bang_olufsen_websocket_event` event types, where `device_id` or `serial_number` can be used to differentiate devices.

### Getting Deezer URIs

To find Deezer playlist, album URIs, and user IDs for Deezer flows, the Deezer website has to be accessed. When navigating to an album, the URL will look something like: <https://www.deezer.com/en/album/ALBUM_ID>, and this needs to be converted to: `album:ALBUM_ID` and the same applies to playlists, which have the format: `playlist:PLAYLIST_ID`.

Additionally a Deezer user ID can be found at <https://www.deezer.com/en/profile/USER_ID> by selecting the active user in a web browser.

### Getting Tidal URIs
Tidal playlists, album URIs and track IDs are available via the Tidal website. When navigating to an album, the URL will look something like <https://listen.tidal.com/album/ALBUM_ID/>, and this needs to be converted to `album:ALBUM_ID`. The same applies to playlists, which have the format `playlist:PLAYLIST_ID`. Individual tracks can be found by sharing the track and selecting the `Copy track link` method, which should yield a link of the format <https://tidal.com/browse/track/TRACK_ID?u>, this can be played by extracting the track id `TRACK_ID`.
