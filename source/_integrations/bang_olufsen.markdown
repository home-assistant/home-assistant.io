Playing a Deezer flow. Optionally define a Deezer user ID:

```yaml

  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: deezer
  media_content_id: flow
  extra:
    id: 1234567890
```

Playing a Deezer playlist. Optionally define starting position for the playlist:

```yaml
service: media_player.play_media
target:
  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: deezer
  media_content_id: playlist:1234567890
  extra:

```yaml

  entity_id: media_player.beosound_balance_12345678
data:
  media_content_type: deezer

data:
  media_content_type: deezer

```

## Automations

WebSocket notifications received from the device are fired as events in Home Assistant. These can be received by listening to `bang_olufsen_websocket_event` event types, where `device_id` or `serial_number` can be used to differentiate devices.

### Getting Deezer URIs

To find Deezer playlist, album URIs, and user IDs for Deezer flows, the Deezer website has to be accessed. When navigating to an album, the URL will look something like: <https://www.deezer.com/en/album/ALBUM_ID>, and this needs to be converted to: `album:ALBUM_ID` and the same applies to playlists, which have the format: `playlist:PLAYLIST_ID`.

Additionally a Deezer user ID can be found at <https://www.deezer.com/en/profile/USER_ID> by selecting the active user in a web browser.
