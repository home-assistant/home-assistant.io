The `mqtt` vacuum {% term integration %} allows you to control your MQTT-enabled vacuum.
The initial state of the MQTT vacuum {% term entity %} will set to `unknown` and can be reset by a device by sending a `null` payload as state.

```

## MQTT Protocol

The  configuration for this integration expects an MQTT protocol like the following.

### Basic Commands

MQTT topic: `vacuum/command`

Possible MQTT payloads:

- `start` - Start cleaning
- `pause` - Pause cleaning
- `return_to_base` - Return to base/dock
- `stop` - Stop the vacuum.
- `clean_spot` - Initialize a spot cleaning cycle
- `locate` - Locate the vacuum (typically by playing a song)

### Send custom command

Vacuum send_command allows three parameters:

- entity_id
- command
- params - optional

If params are not provided it sends command as payload to MQTT send_command topic.
If params are provided service sends JSON as payload with such structure:

```json
{
  'command': 'command',
  'param1-key': 'param1-value'
}
```

Service trigger example:

```yaml
- alias: "Push command based on sensor"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.sensor
    action:
      service: vacuum.send_command
      target:
        entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity
      data:
        command: "custom_command"
        params:
          - key: value
```

MQTT topic: `vacuum/send_command`

### Status/Sensor Updates

MQTT topic: `vacuum/state`

MQTT payload:

```json
{
    "battery_level": 61,
    "state": "docked",
    "fan_speed": "off"
}
```

State has to be one of vacuum states supported by Home Assistant:

- cleaning,
- docked,
- paused,
- idle,
- returning,
- error.

### Set Fan Speed

MQTT topic: `vacuum/set_fan_speed`

Possible MQTT payloads:

- `min` - Minimum fan speed
- `medium` - Medium fan speed
- `high` - High fan speed
- `max` - Max fan speed

## Usage examples

### Usage with cloudless Xiaomi vacuums

This integration is supported by the cloud-free Xiaomi Vacuum Webinterface [Valetudo](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo).

### Retrofitting non-wifi vacuums

- Retrofitting your old Roomba with an ESP8266. [This repository](https://github.com/johnboiles/esp-roomba-mqtt) provides MQTT client firmware.
- If you own a non-wifi Neato, you can refer to [this repository](https://github.com/jeroenterheerdt/neato-serial) that uses a Raspberry Pi to retrofit an old Neato.
