The `opentherm_gw` integration is used to control the [OpenTherm Gateway](https://otgw.tclcode.com/) from Home Assistant.

The following device types are currently supported within Home Assistant:

- Binary sensor
- Climate
- Sensor

This integration will add three devices to Home Assistant for each configured gateway. The main control of the integration is a single `climate` entity which can be found on the added `OpenTherm Thermostat` device. All added devices have a collection of `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities, which are disabled by default. To enable them, follow the steps on [enabling entities](/common-tasks/general/#enabling-or-disabling-entities).

{% note %}
The OpenTherm protocol is based on polling. The thermostat sends requests to the boiler at specific intervals. As a result, it may take some time for changes to propagate between Home Assistant and the thermostat.
{% endnote %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The following configuration options are available:

{% configuration_basic %}
name:
  description: "The friendly name used for the OpenTherm Gateway and its entities. This is used to generate the display name of the created device and all related entities.<br/>Examples: `Thermostat`, `Living Room`"
path or url:
  description: "Path to the OpenTherm Gateway device as supported by [PySerial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/url_handlers.html). This is usually either a path to a serial device in `/dev/` if the gateway is connected via serial or USB, or a URL in the form of `socket://[IP address]:[port]` if it is connected over the network.<br/>Examples: `/dev/ttyUSB0`, `socket://192.168.0.250:7686`"
id:
  description: "The `gateway_id` for this OpenTherm Gateway. This is used to identify this specific gateway in action and to generate the entity IDs for the entities related to this gateway. The entered value will be slugified, i.e. all spaces and special characters will be converted to underscores and any accents will be removed from their characters. The default value is the slugified version of the `name` given above.<br/>Examples: `thermostat`, `living_room`"
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

{% important %}
Please make sure no other device or application is connected to the OpenTherm Gateway at the same time as Home Assistant. This is not a supported scenario and may lead to unexpected results.
{% endimportant %}

{% note %}
The precision and floor_temperature settings that were supported in configuration.yaml entries have been lost upon import of the `configuration.yaml` entry into the Integrations panel. You can now configure them as per the following Options paragraph.
{% endnote %}

# Options

The OpenTherm Gateway can be further configured through the integration settings in the web interface.

The following options are available:
{% configuration_basic %}
Read Precision:
  description: "The desired read precision for this device. Used to display the current temperature on the climate entity. Can be used to match your actual thermostat's precision. Set to `0` to use the default value for your unit preference."
Set Precision:
  description: "The desired set precision for this device. Used as step size for setting temperature setpoint from the climate entity. Can be used to match your actual thermostat's precision. Set to `0` to use the default value for your unit preference."
Temporary Setpoint Override Mode:
  description: "The desired setpoint override mode. When Temporary Setpoint Override Mode is set to on, the thermostat will be able to cancel the setpoint override after a program change. When the option is set to off, the Setpoint Override Mode will be ‘Constant’ and a manual temperature adjustment on the thermostat is needed to cancel the setpoint override."
Floor Temperature:
  description: "Some thermostats round all temperatures down to the lower value according to their precision. Default behavior for Home Assistant is to round temperatures to the nearest value. Enable this setting to override this behavior and round to the lower value according to the configured precision."
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## Actions

### Action `opentherm_gw.reset_gateway`

Reset the OpenTherm Gateway.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `gateway_id`           | no       | The `gateway_id` as specified during configuration. |

### Action `set_central_heating_ovrd`

Set the central heating override option on the gateway.
When overriding the control setpoint (via the [set_control_setpoint](#action-opentherm_gwset_control_setpoint) action with a temperature value other than `0`), the gateway automatically enables the central heating override to start heating. This action can then be used to control the central heating override status.
To return control of the central heating to the thermostat, use the [set_control_setpoint](#action-opentherm_gwset_control_setpoint) action with temperature value `0`.
**You will only need this if you are writing your own software thermostat.**

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gateway_id`           | no       | The `gateway_id` as specified during configuration.                                      |
| `ch_override`          | no       | The desired value for the central heating override. Use `0` to disable or `1` to enable. |

{% warning %}
Please read [this information](http://otgw.tclcode.com/standalone.html) from the designer of the OpenTherm Gateway before considering to write your own software thermostat.
{% endwarning %}

### Action `opentherm_gw.set_clock`

Provide the time and day of week to the OpenTherm Gateway. The value provided here will be forwarded to the thermostat on the next date/time request from the thermostat. The OpenTherm Gateway does not have the ability to accurately keep track of time, so it will only retain the information provided here for a maximum of about 61 seconds.

| Data attribute | Optional | Default      | Description                                                              |

| `date`                 | yes      | Today's date | Date from which the day of week will be extracted. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `time`                 | yes      | Current time | Time in 24h format.                                                      |

### Action `opentherm_gw.set_control_setpoint`

{% caution %}
Improper use of this action may continuously keep your central heating system active, resulting in an overheated house and a significant increase in gas and/or electricity consumption.
{% endcaution %}

Set the central heating control setpoint override on the OpenTherm Gateway.
In a normal situation, the thermostat will calculate and control the central heating setpoint on the boiler. Setting this to any value other than 0 will enable the override and allow the OpenTherm Gateway to control this setting. While the override is active, the OpenTherm Gateway will also request your boiler to activate the central heating circuit. For your boiler's actual maximum and minimum supported setpoint value, please see the `slave_ch_max_setp` and `slave_ch_min_setp` [sensors](#sensors). Due to the potential consequences of leaving this setting enabled for prolonged periods, the override will be disabled when Home Assistant is shut down or restarted.
**You will only need this if you are writing your own software thermostat.**

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
