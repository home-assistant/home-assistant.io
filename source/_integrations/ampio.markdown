The `ampio` air quality platform will query the open data API of [ampio.pl](http://smog.ampio.pl/) to monitor air quality sensor station.

## Setup

To get the ID of a station you need to contact Ampio directly.

## Manual configuration

To enable this platform, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
air_quality:
  - platform: ampio
    station_id: STATION_ID
```

{% configuration %}
station_id:

  required: true
  type: string
name:

  required: false
  default: Station name
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
