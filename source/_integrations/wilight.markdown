## Fan

The `wilight` integration allows you to control your Fans from within Home Assistant.

### Fan Services

There are several services which can be used for automations and control of the fan:

| Service | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `set_percentage` | Calling this service sets the fan speed (`entity_id` and `percentage` are required parameters). Percentage must be in the range 0-100, percentage = 0 turns off the fan. There are three speed levels 33%, 66% and 100%. Adjusting to intermediate levels goes to the next higher level.
| `set_direction` | Calling this service will set the fan direction (`entity_id` and `direction` are required parameters, and direction must be one of the following: forward or reverse). Calling this service will turn the fan on.
| `toggle` | Calling this service will toggle the fan between on and off states (`entity_id` is required).
| `turn_off` | Calling this service will turn the fan off (`entity_id` is required).
| `turn_on` | Calling this service will turn the fan on and set the speed and direction to the last used ones (defaults to high and forward, `entity_id` is required).

## Irrigation

The `wilight` integration allows you to control your Irrigation from within Home Assistant. This is exposed via switches in Home Assistant.
There are two switch types for Irrigation: `watering switch` and `pause switch`.
A `watering switch` can turn on and off the irrigation valve, while the `pause switch` can disable / enable the action of a `watering switch`.
`Triggers` activate (turn on) the `watering switch` (irrigation valve) at the programmed time. The trigger can be set to run on a day of the week or only once (today).

### Irrigation Services

There are several services which can be used for automations and control of the Irrigation:

- For `watering switch`:

| Service | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `turn_off` | Calling this service will turn the irrigation valve off (`entity_id` is required).
| `turn_on` | Calling this service will turn the irrigation valve on (`entity_id` is required).
| `set_watering_time` | Calling this service sets the watering time (`entity_id` and `watering_time` are required parameters), `watering_time` must be in the range 1-1800 seconds.
| `set_trigger` | Calling this service sets the trigger_1, trigger_2, trigger_3 or trigger_4 (`entity_id`, `trigger_index` and `trigger` are required parameters), `trigger_index` must be between 1 and 4 and `trigger` must be according Trigger rules (see below).

- For `pause switch`:

| Service | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `turn_off` | Calling this service will turn the pause switch off, enabling watering switch (`entity_id` is required).
| `turn_on` | Calling this service will turn the pause switch on, disabling watering switch (`entity_id` is required).
| `set_pause_time` | Calling this service sets the pause time (`entity_id` and `pause_time` are required parameters), `pause_time` must be in the range 1-24 hours.

Trigger rules:
- String with 8 decimal characters ("0" to "9").
- The first three characters (String[0,3]) represent an integer from 0 to 127, which corresponds to Bitfield of: 1 - Sunday, 2 - Monday, 4 - Tuesday, 8 - Wednesday, 16 - Thursday, 32 - Friday and 64 - Saturday. Setting zero, trigger is only valid for today.
- String[3,5] represents the hour of trigger, from 0 to 23.
- String[5,7] represents the minute of trigger, from 0 to 59.
- String[7,8] represents the enable trigger, 0 - disabled, 1- enabled.
