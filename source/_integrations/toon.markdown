The Toon integration platform can be used to control your Quby Toon thermostat,
which is currently being sold as:

- Eneco Toon
- Engie Electrabel Boxx
- Viesgo Toon

This integration adds a climate device for your Toon thermostat, some switches
allowing you to control the program and holiday mode of the thermostats as well.

Sensors for energy, power and gas consumption, sensors for solar production and
several binary sensors for things like boiler burner on/off, hot tap water and
boiler health status.

For the Toon integration to work, you'll need an active Toon subscription
and a Toon API developer account.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

## Setting up a developer account

In order to be able to use this integration, you'll need to sign up for a free Toon API developer account.

1. Visit the [Toon API developers website](https://developer.toon.eu/), and [sign in](https://developer.toon.eu/user/login). [Create an account](https://developer.toon.eu/user/register) if you donâ€™t have one already.
2. Open the "[My Apps](https://developer.toon.eu/user/me/apps)" page and click on "Add a new App" button on the top right.
3. The "Add App" page shows a form with two fields:
   - **App Name**: Can be anything you like, for example, "Home Assistant" will just do.
   - **Callback URL**: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`.
4. Click on "Create App" to complete the creation process.
5. Open the "[My Apps](https://developer.toon.eu/user/me/apps)" page again and click on the app that you've just created.
6. You need the codes now shown: "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret".
7. Add the following Toon configuration to your `configuration.yaml` and restart Home Assistant.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
toon:
  client_id: YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
  client_secret: YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
```

{% configuration %}
client_id:
  description: Toon API Consumer Key.
  required: true
  type: string
client_secret:
  description: Toon API Consumer Secret.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% details "I have manually disabled My Home Assistant" %}

If you don't have [My Home Assistant](/integrations/my) on your installation,
you can use `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>/auth/external/callback` as the Callback URL
instead.

The `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>` must be the same as used during the configuration/
authentication process.

Internal examples: `http://192.168.0.2:8123/auth/external/callback`, `http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/external/callback`." 

{% enddetails %}

## Binary sensor

The Toon integration provides the following binary sensors:

- Boiler Burner (only with OpenTherm)
