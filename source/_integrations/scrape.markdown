The `scrape` sensor {% term integration %} is scraping information from websites. The sensor loads an HTML page and gives you the option to search and split out a value. As this is not a full-blown web scraper like [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/), it will most likely only work with simple web pages and it can be time-consuming to get the right section.

If you are not using Home Assistant Container or Home Assistant Operating System, this integration requires `libxml2` to be installed. On Debian based installs, run:

```bash
sudo apt install libxml2
```

Both UI and YAML setup is supported while YAML provides additional configuration possibilities.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

To enable this {% term integration %} using YAML, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
scrape:
  - resource: https://www.home-assistant.io

## Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor. There is also a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/home-assistant/home-assistant-notebooks/blob/master/other/web-scraping.ipynb) available for this example to give you a bit more insight.

### Home Assistant

The current release Home Assistant is published on [homepage](/)

{% raw %}

```yaml
scrape:
# Example configuration.yaml entry
  - resource: https://www.home-assistant.io
    sensor:
      - name: Release
        select: ".current-version h1"
        value_template: '{{ value.split(":")[1] }}'
```

{% endraw %}

### Available implementations

Get the counter for all our implementations from the integrations page under {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %}.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
scrape:
  - resource: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/
    sensor:
      - name: Home Assistant impl.
        select: 'a[href="#all"]'
        value_template: '{{ value.split("(")[1].split(")")[0] }}'
```

{% endraw %}

### Get a value out of a tag

The German [Federal Office for Radiation protection (Bundesamt fÃ¼r Strahlenschutz)](https://www.bfs.de/) is publishing various details about optical radiation including an UV index. This example is getting the index for a region in Germany.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
scrape:
  - resource: https://www.bfs.de/DE/themen/opt/uv/uv-index/prognose/prognose_node.html
    sensor:
      - name: Coast Ostsee
        select: "p"
        index: 19
        unit_of_measurement: "UV Index"
```

### IFTTT status

If you make heavy use of the [IFTTT](/integrations/ifttt/) web service for your automations and are curious about the [status of IFTTT](https://status.ifttt.com/) then you can display the current state of IFTTT in your frontend.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
scrape:
  - resource: https://status.ifttt.com/
    sensor:
      - name: IFTTT status
        select: ".component-status"
```

### Get the latest podcast episode file URL

If you want to get the file URL for the latest episode of your [favorite podcast](https://hasspodcast.io/), so you can pass it on to a compatible media player.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
scrape:
  - resource: https://hasspodcast.io/feed/podcast
    sensor:
      - name: Home Assistant Podcast
        select: "enclosure"
        index: 1
        attribute: url
```

### Energy price

This example tries to retrieve the price for electricity.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
scrape:
  - resource: https://elen.nu/dagens-spotpris/se3-stockholm/

      - name: Electricity price
        select: ".text-lg.font-bold"
        index: 1
        value_template: '{{ value | replace (",", ".") | float }}'
        unit_of_measurement: "Ã¶re/kWh"
```

{% endraw %}

### Container cleaning by CleanProfs in The Netherlands

This example gets the container type and container cleaning date for the next two cleanings.

# Example configuration.yaml entry. Change postal code and house number to your own address.
scrape:
  - resource: https://crm.cleanprofs.nl/search/planning
    method: POST
    payload: zipcode=5624JW&street_number=17
    headers:
