Retrieve train departure information from [Trafikverket](https://www.trafikverket.se/).

## Use cases

- Retrieve the next departure between two stations.
- Retrieve information for specific departure time between two stations.
- Set up an alert or perform actions if your train is delayed or canceled.

## Retrieved data

- Next departure for the specific train line.
- Canceled status.
- Delayed time.
- Planned time if no delays occur.
- Estimated time of arrival if delays occur.
- Actual time - when it did arrive.
- Other information / additional texts.
- Deviations.

The next departure is calculated from actual, estimated, and planned to provide the most accurate information about departure.

If a specific departure time has not been set, the integration will return the 3 next departures.

You can filter based on product descriptions such as `SJ Regionalt√•g` to only see specific trains between the two stations.
