The `fleetgo` device tracker {% term integration %} allows you to integrate your vehicles equipped with [FleetGO](https://fleetgo.com) hardware into Home Assistant. It allows you to see certain details about your vehicle, but also shows your vehicle on the map.

## Setup

To use this {% term integration %}, you need an **API key** and **API secret**, which can be requested by contacting [info@fleetgo.com](mailto:info@fleetgo.com?subject=API%20Key).

## Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
