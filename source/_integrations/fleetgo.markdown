The `fleetgo` device tracker platform allows you to integrate your vehicles equipped with [FleetGO](https://fleetgo.com) hardware into Home Assistant. It allows you to see certain details about your vehicle, but also shows your vehicle on the map.

## Setup

To use this component, you need an **API key** and **API secret**, which can be requested by contacting [info@fleetgo.com](mailto:info@fleetgo.com?subject=API%20Key).

## Configuration

To use this device tracker in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

    client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    username: YOUR_FLEETGO_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_FLEETGO_PASSWORD
    include:
        - LICENSE_PLATE
```
