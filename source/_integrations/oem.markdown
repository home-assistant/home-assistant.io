This {% term integration %} supports the ESP8266 based "WiFi MQTT Relay / Thermostat" sold by [OpenEnergyMonitor](https://web.archive.org/web/20220426080315/https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/wifi-mqtt-relay-thermostat/) (archived page, no longer for sale). The underlying [library](https://oemthermostat.readthedocs.io/) only supports this single relay variant of the [original device](https://harizanov.com/2014/12/wifi-iot-3-channel-relay-board-with-mqtt-and-http-api-using-esp8266/).

This platform controls the setpoint of the thermostat in its "manual" mode.

To set it up, add the following information to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
