The **Waze Travel Time** {% term integration %} provides travel time from the [Waze](https://www.waze.com/).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

Notes:

- If a unit system is not specified, the {% term integration %} will use the unit system configured on your Home Assistant instance.
- **Origin** and **Destination** can be the address or the GPS coordinates of the location. For coordinates, use the following format: `52.5200, 13.4050`. Make sure the coordinates are separated by a comma. They must not include letters. You can also enter an entity id which provides this information in its state, an entity id with latitude and longitude attributes, or zone friendly name (case sensitive).
- The string inputs for `Substring *` allow you to force the {% term integration %} to use a particular route or avoid a particular route in its time travel calculation. These inputs are case insensitive and matched against the description of the route.
- When using the `Avoid Toll Roads?`, `Avoid Subscription Roads?` and `Avoid Ferries?` options, be aware that Waze will sometimes still route you over toll roads or ferries if a valid vignette/subscription is assumed. Default behavior is that Waze will route you over roads having subscription options. It is therefor best is to set both `Avoid Toll Roads?` and `Avoid Subscription Roads?` or `Avoid Ferries?` if needed and experiment to ensure the desired outcome.

## Action `waze_travel_time.get_travel_times`

This service populates [response data](/docs/scripts/perform-actions#use-templates-to-handle-response-data)
with route alternatives and travel times between two locations.

| `destination` | no | The destination of the route | "51.330436, 3.802043" |
| `region` | no | The region. Controls which waze server is used. | "us" |
| `units` | yes | Which unit system to use | metric |
| `vehicle_type` | yes | Which vehicle to use | "car" |
| `incl_filter` | yes | Which street names must be part of the route | "A321" |
| `excl_filter` | yes | Which street names must not be part of the route | "A321" |
| `realtime` | yes | Use real-time or statistical data | True |
| `avoid_toll_roads` | yes | Whether to avoid toll roads | True |
| `avoid_ferries` | yes | Whether to avoid ferries | True |

## Defining a custom polling interval

{% include common-tasks/define_custom_polling.md %}

## Example using dynamic destination

Using the flexible option to set a sensor value to the `Destination`, you can setup a single Waze {% term integration %} that will calculate travel time to multiple optional locations on demand.

In the following example, the `Input Select` is converted into an address which is used to modify the destination for the Waze route calculation from the `device_tracker.myphone` location. It takes a few minutes for the value to update due to the interval of Waze data fetching.

{% raw %}

```yaml
input_select:
  destination:
    name: destination
    options:
      - Home
      - Work
      - Parents

template:
  - sensor:
     - name: "Destination address"
       state: >-
          {%- if is_state("input_select.destination", "Home")  -%}
            725 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022, USA
          {%- elif is_state("input_select.destination", "Work")  -%}
            767 5th Ave, New York, NY 10153, USA
          {%- elif is_state("input_select.destination", "Parents")  -%}
            178 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11211, USA
          {%- else -%}
            Unknown
          {%- endif %}

```

{% endraw %}

### Various configurations that are supported

#### Tracking entity to entity

In this example, we use a device_tracker entity ID as the origin and the sensor created above as the destination.

  - Name: "Me to some destination"
  - Origin: `device_tracker.myphone`
  - Destination: `sensor.dest_address`
  - Region: "US"

#### Tracking entity to zone friendly name

In this example we are using the entity ID of a zone as the origin and the friendly name of a zone as the destination.

  - Name: "Home to Eddie's house"
  - Origin: `zone.home`
  - Destination: "Eddies House"
  - Region: "US"

#### Tracking entity in imperial units

  - Name: "Somewhere in New York"
  - Origin: `person.paulus`
  - Destination: "725 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022, USA"
  - Region: "US"
  - Units: "imperial"
  - Vehicle Type: "motorcycle"

#### Avoiding toll, subscription

  - Name: "Westerscheldetunnel"
  - Origin: "51.330436, 3.802043"
  - Destination: "51.445677, 3.749929"
  - Region: "EU"
  - Avoid Toll Roads: `True`
  - Avoid Subscription Roads: `True`
