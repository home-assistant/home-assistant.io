The `flo` integration integrates
[Flo by Moen smart water shutoff valves](https://www.moen.com/flo) into Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Binary sensor**: reports whether or not there are any alerts.
- **Sensor**: reports on the device's system mode, water flow rate, temperature, water pressure, and daily water consumption.
- **Switch**: allows the user to open and close the valve on the water shutoff device.
