The **YouTube** {% term integration %} allows you to connect YouTube channels to Home Assistant.
For every channel you add, it will create sensors for:
- Subscriber count
- The latest uploaded video

## Prerequisites

To be able to configure the {% term integration %}, you need to have a YouTube channel.
To learn how to create one, refer to the [YouTube documentation](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1646861).

You need to configure developer credentials to allow Home Assistant to access your Google Account.
These credentials are the same as the ones for [Nest](/integrations/nest), [Google Mail](/integrations/google_mail) and [Google Sheets](/integrations/google_sheets).
These are not the same as the one for [Google Calendar](/integrations/google).
