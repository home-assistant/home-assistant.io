The DuckDNS {% term integration %} allows you to keep your DuckDNS subdomain always in sync with your public IP address. [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org) is a free service that allows you to bind your own favorite subdomain under `duckdns.org` to the public IP address in use from your router, even though such address is dynamically allocated by your internet service provider and therefore changes over time.

{% warning %}

If you are running the Home Assistant DuckDNS add-on this integration is not required. The add-on will keep your IP updated with DuckDNS.

{% endwarning %}

## Configuration

To use the integration in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
duckdns:
  domain: YOUR_SUBDOMAIN
  access_token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

{% configuration duckdns %}
  domain:
    description: Your duckdns subdomain (without the `.duckdns.org` suffix).
    required: true
    type: string
  access_token:
    description: Your DuckDNS access token. Log in to the site to get one.
    required: true
    type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
