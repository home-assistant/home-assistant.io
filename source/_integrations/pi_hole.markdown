The Pi-hole integration allows you to retrieve statistics and interact with a
[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) system.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

During the setup, it will ask for the following:

| Item | Description | Example |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `Host` | The IP or domain name to Pi-Hole | 192.168.1.1 |
| `Port` | Port used to get to the admin page | 80 |
| `Name` | Name to for this Pi-Hole. | Pi-Hole |
| `Location` | the path to the admin page. | /admin |

The combined host, port and location should take you to the login page of Pi-Hole. Using the example above, it would be `http://192.168.1.1:80/admin`.

If your Pi-hole web interface is password protected, an API key will be requested by Home Assistant after submitting the initial details above. You can get the API key by logging into your Pi-Hole and going to _from Settings > API_ and then the **Show API token** button.

## Services

The platform provides the following services to interact with your Pi-hole. Use switch entities when calling the services.

### Service `pi_hole.disable`

Disables configured Pi-hole(s) for the specified amount of time.

| Service data attribute | Required | Type | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | `False` | string | Target switch entity. Use `all` to target all Pi-hole services |
| `duration` | `True` | timedelta | Time for which Pi-hole should be disabled |

Example service call:

```yaml
# Example service call to disable Pi-Hole for 30 minutes
service: pi_hole.disable
data:
  duration: '00:30'
target:
  entity_id: all
```

## Switches

The integration creates a switch for the Pi-hole allowing you to toggle the Pi-hole on and off.
