The `telnet` switch platform allows you to control devices with telnet commands.

To enable this switch, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: telnet
    switches:
      projector:
        resource: THE_IP_ADDRESS
        port: 4002
        command_on: "PWR ON"
        command_off: "PWR OFF"
        command_state: "PWR?"
        value_template: '{{ value == "PWR=01" }}'
        timeout: 0.9
```

{% endraw %}
