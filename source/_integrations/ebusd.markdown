Integration between the [ebusd](https://github.com/john30/ebusd/) daemon (used for communication with the eBUS heating systems), and Home Assistant. The ebusd integrations uses the sensor integration.

## Configuration

Enable the sensor by adding the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
ebusd:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  circuit: "700"
```
