Integration between [ebusd](https://github.com/john30/ebusd/) daemon for communication with eBUS heating systems, and Home Assistant using sensor component.

## Configuration

Enable the sensor by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
ebusd:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  circuit: "700"
```

{% configuration %}
host:
