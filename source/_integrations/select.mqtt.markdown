The `mqtt` Select platform allows you to integrate devices that might expose configuration options through MQTT into Home Assistant as a Select. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the select entity will be updated in Home Assistant and vice-versa, keeping the device and Home Assistant in sync.

## Configuration

To enable MQTT Select in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - select:
      command_topic: topic
      name: "Test Select"
      options:
        - "Option 1"
        - "Option 2"
```
