Need your API credentials? See [how to get the API credentials](#how-to-get-the-api-credentials).

## Options

Menu: *Configuration* > *Integrations* > *Select your new integration* > *Press the cog in the upper left corner*

- **select lines**: filter the departures on the station to only show departures for the selected lines.
- **offset**: set this if you want to list the departures some minutes in the future, for example, if you live ten minutes away from the station.
- **use realtime data**: enable this to include delay and cancellation information.

## Departure sensors

The integration creates one sensor for the departures at the selected station.

### States

The state is a timestamp representing the time for the next departure, not including delays.

### Attributes

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                                              |

| `line`      | Line number of the next departure                                                                                        |
| `origin`    | The station where the transport started from                                                                             |

| `delay`     | Real-time data about the delay of the transport in seconds. Add this to the departure time to get the real departure time |
| `next`      | A list of the upcoming departures. Each element has the above attributes and `departure` containing the timestamp        |

## Elevator sensors

If the selected station has elevators, binary sensors will be available.

### States

- OK (`off`): The elevator is working.
- Problem (`on`): The elevator is out of order. See the cause attribute for more information.

## How to get the API credentials

You have to apply for credentials via the HVV website. You can see their official guide [here](https://www.hvv.de/de/fahrplaene/abruf-fahrplaninfos/datenabruf) (the page is only available in German).

In your mail, tell them you are using your API credentials for use within Home Assistant. They will send you a contract you will have to sign and send back. After about a week, you will receive your API credentials.
