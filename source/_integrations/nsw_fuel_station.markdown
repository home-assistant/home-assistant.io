The `nsw_fuel_station` sensor platform uses the [NSW Fuel Check App](https://www.fuelcheck.nsw.gov.au/app) data as a source for current fuel price data.

## Setup

To get the station ID for any NSW fuel station you will need to:

- Visit the [Fuel Check App](https://www.fuelcheck.nsw.gov.au/app).
- Open the developer console of your browser (for Chrome, click View -> Developer -> Developer Tools). Click the "Network" tab in the developer console.
- In the Fuel Check App, search for your postcode or click "Fuel Near Me".
- In the developer console, you should see a request to `/FuelCheckApp/v1/fuel/prices/bylocation`. Open this request and preview the response. Find the station you wish to add, and copy down the `ServiceStationID` field.

Alternatively:

- Select a station you wish to find the ID for.
- Select "Report this Station".
- In the URL of the new page opened, locate `serviceStationId`.

## Configuration

To add the NSW fuel station price sensor to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: nsw_fuel_station
    station_id: 291
```

{% configuration %}
