The **Yale Smart Living** {% term integration %} provides connectivity with the Yale Smart Alarm systems and Smart Hub through Yale's API.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Alarm
- Binary sensor
- Button
- Lock

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Alarm control panel

Services provided are `armed_away`, `armed_home`, and `disarmed`.

No code is required to operate the alarm.

## Binary sensors

Provides support for contact sensors for doors showing if door is open or closed.

## Button

Provides support for pressing the panic button to trigger the alarm. Be careful as another press does not reset/turn off panic mode.

## Lock

The lock platform requires a code for unlocking but no code for locking.

The {% term integration %} can be configured to provide a default code that is used if no code is supplied and the number of digits required.
