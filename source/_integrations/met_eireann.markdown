The Met Éireann integration uses the [Met Éireann](https://met.ie) (The Irish Meteorological Service) Public Weather Forecast API to provide current and forecasted weather data for a given location. This integration is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Met Éireann.

<div class="note">

The Met Éireann API will only provide data for Ireland, the UK and a small part of northern France. For specific coverage, please see the Notes on API document available [here](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/met-eireann-weather-forecast-api/resource/027da6d5-d819-48d1-9b16-331dba169bd1).

In short, if you distribute, broadcast or make Met Éireann data available on the public internet you must give credit to Met Éireann and display their weather warnings.

## Data changes

The only changes made to the data gathered from the API are the condition descriptions which are mapped to the weather conditions supported by Home Assistant.
