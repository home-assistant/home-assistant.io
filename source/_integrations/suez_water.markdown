The Suez Water integration fetches your last day consumption of water from the French water provider [Tout Sur Mon Eau](https://www.toutsurmoneau.fr) website.

It also gets the following data:

- Daily consumption for the current month
- Daily consumption for the previous month
- Monthly consumption for the last 26 months
- Highest monthly consumption
- Last year total consumption
- Current year total consumption

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

`counter_id` is the water counter id. It can be found on your _Tout Sur Mon Eau_ [user account](https://www.toutsurmoneau.fr/mon-compte-en-ligne/historique-de-consommation-tr). Look in the source code of the page for something similar to `url: '/mon-compte-en-ligne/statMData' + '/123456789'`. The `counter_id` in this case is `123456789`.
