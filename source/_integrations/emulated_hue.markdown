{% warning %}

Be aware that `emulated_hue` doesn't work for new users of **Google Home** with `emulated_hue`. If you've not previously set this up and had it working, use the [Google Assistant](/integrations/google_assistant/) integration or [Nabu Casa cloud](/integrations/cloud) integration.

{% endwarning %}

The `emulated_hue` {% term integration %} provides a virtual [Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com) bridge, written entirely in software that allows services that work with the Hue API to interact with Home Assistant
entities. The driving use case behind this functionality is to allow Home Assistant to work with an Amazon Echo or Google Home with no setup cost outside of configuration changes.
The virtual bridge can turn entities on/off or change the brightness of dimmable lights. The volume level of media players can be controlled as brightness.

{% important %}
A physical Hue Bridge is required for Philips Hue lights to function - this virtual bridge will not replace a physical bridge. Instead, it allows Home Assistant to represent non-Philips Hue devices to Amazon Echo as Philips Hue devices, which Amazon Echo can control with built-in support.
{% endimportant %}

{% tip %}
It is recommended to assign a static IP address to the computer running Home Assistant. This is because the Amazon Echo discovers devices by IP addresses, and if the IP changes, the Echo won't be able to control it. This is easiest done from your router, see your router's manual for details.
{% endtip %}

{% note %}

Both Google Home and Alexa use the device they were initially set up with for communication with `emulated_hue`. In other words: if you remove/replace this device you will also break `emulated_hue`. To recover your `emulated_hue` functionality, backup your `config/.storage/emulated_hue.ids` file, delete the original one and reboot your Home Assistant instance.

If you added or upgraded to a newer Alexa device and devices are not found, you must change to listen_port: 80. If Alexa responds with "value is out of range for device..." it means switches were automatically added as lights in discovery. Remove each device in the Alexa app. Turn on all the switches in Home Assistant. In the Alexa app go to "Add New Device" select "Switch" and then "other" to add them correctly.

{% endnote %}

{% note %}

[Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com) and [Sleep as Android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org): smart alarm clock app can use emulated_hue to turn on and off entities. Sleep Cycle only has it implemented in the iOS app, see [Sleep Cycle support](https://support.sleepcycle.com/hc/articles/207670385-Does-Sleep-Cycle-integrates-with-Phillips-Hue-). The app requires the same configuration as Google Home and does not work if the type is defined as Alexa in the configuration.

{% endnote %}

{% note %}
  
Logitech Harmony remotes cannot connect to this emulator via Android and iOS mobile applications because they require the physical button on the hub to be pressed. The [MyHarmony desktop software](https://support.myharmony.com/download) must be used with the original cable to connect it, then "Scan for Devices". 
  
{% endnote %}

### Configuration

To enable the emulated Hue bridge, add one of the following configs to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Google Home example configuration.yaml entry
emulated_hue:
  listen_port: 80
  # Google Home does not work on different ports.
```

```yaml
# Amazon Echo example configuration.yaml entry
emulated_hue:
  listen_port: 80
  # Amazon Echo/Alexa stopped working on different ports. Search for "Philips Hue Bridge V1 (round)" in the Alexa App to discover devices.
```

{% configuration %}
type:
  description: The type of assistant which we are emulating. Either `alexa` or `google_home`. **This configuration option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. It is no longer necessary to define type.**
  required: false
  type: string
  default: google_home
host_ip:
  description: The IP address that your Home Assistant installation is running on. If you do not specify this option, the integration will attempt to determine the IP address on its own.
  required: false
  type: string
listen_port:
  description: "The port the Hue bridge API web server will run on. This can be any free port on your system. However, all new Alexa devices require listen_port: 80. See `setcap` note below if this is set below `1024` when Home Assistant is ran as a non-root user."
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 8300
advertise_ip:
  description: If you need to override the IP address used for UPnP discovery. (For example, using network isolation in Docker)
  required: false
  type: string
advertise_port:
  description: If you need to specifically override the advertised UPnP port.
  required: false
  type: integer
upnp_bind_multicast:
  description: Whether or not to bind the UPnP (SSDP) listener to the multicast address (239.255.255.250) or instead to the (unicast) host_ip address specified above (or automatically determined). In special circumstances, like running in a FreeBSD or FreeNAS jail, you may need to disable this.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
off_maps_to_on_domains:
  description: The domains that maps an "off" command to an "on" command. For example, if `script` is included in the list, and you ask Alexa to "turn off the *water plants* script," the command will be handled as if you asked her to turn on the script.
  required: false
  type: list
  default: [script, scene]
expose_by_default:
  description: "Whether or not entities should be exposed via the bridge by default instead of explicitly (see the ‘emulated_hue’ customization below). Warning: If you have a lot of devices (more than 49 total across all exposed domains), you should be careful with this option. Exposing more devices than Alexa supports can result in it not seeing any of them. If you are having trouble getting any devices to show up, try disabling this, and explicitly exposing just a few devices at a time to see if that fixes it."
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
exposed_domains:
  description: The domains that are exposed by default if `expose_by_default` is set to true.
  required: false
  type: list
  default: [switch, light, group, input_boolean, media_player, fan, humidifier]
entities:
  description: Customization for entities.
  required: false
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

A full configuration sample looks like the one below.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
emulated_hue:
  host_ip: 192.168.1.186
  listen_port: 8300
  advertise_ip: 10.0.0.10
  advertise_port: 8080
  off_maps_to_on_domains:
    - script
    - scene
  expose_by_default: true
  exposed_domains:
    - light
  entities:
    light.bedroom_light:
      name: "Bedside Lamp"
    light.ceiling_lights:
      hidden: true
```

The following are attributes that can be applied in the `entities` section:

- **name** (*Optional*): The name that the emulated Hue will use. The default for this is the entity's friendly name.
- **hidden** (*Optional*): Whether or not the emulated Hue bridge should expose the entity. Adding `hidden: false` will expose the entity to Alexa. The default value for this attribute is controlled by the `expose_by_default` option.

{% note %}

These attributes used to be found under the `customize` section of `homeassistant`, however, they have now been moved to `entities`. Emulated Hue configuration under `homeassistant.customize` will be deprecated in the near future.

{% endnote %}

### Troubleshooting

You can verify that the `emulated_hue` integration has been loaded and is responding by pointing a local browser to the following URL:

- `http://<HA IP Address>:80/description.xml` - This URL should return a descriptor file in the form of an XML file.
- `http://<HA IP Address>:80/api/v2/lights` - This will return a list of devices, lights, scenes, groups, etc.. that `emulated_hue` is exposing to Alexa.

Verify that the URLs above are using port 80, rather than port 8300 (i.e., `http://<HA IP Address>:80/description.xml`). Both Google Home and Amazon Alexa/Echo (as of the 2019-08 firmware) require port 80.

### Platform specific instructions

#### Home Assistant Core

An additional step is required to run Home Assistant as a non-root user and use port 80.

##### Linux

On Linux systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc) execute the following command to allow `emulated_hue` to use port 80 as a non-root user:

```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /srv/homeassistant/homeassistant_venv/bin/python3
```

Please note that your path may be different depending on your installation method. For example, if you followed the [Virtualenv instructions](/installation/linux/), your path will be `/srv/homeassistant/bin/python3`.
