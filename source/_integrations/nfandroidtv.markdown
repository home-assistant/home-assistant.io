Notification integration for [Notifications for Android TV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cyberdream.androidtv.notifications.google) and [Notifications for Fire TV](https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Fees-Notifications-for-Fire/dp/B00OESCXEK). You can use this integration to send notifications to your Android TV device. An overlay with the message content will appear for a configurable amount of seconds and then disappear again. Sending images (e.g., security cam) and custom icons is supported too. Icons are essentially the same as images (any image format supported by Android TV is supported), but are displayed small and to the left of the notification whereas images are large and above the notification.

The notifications are in the global scope of your Android TV device. They will be displayed regardless of which application is running.

When setting this up be aware, that there are two apps: one for your smartphone to send notifications (not required for this platform) and one for your Android TV device to receive the notifications. The app available in the store of your Android TV device is the one that is needed to display notifications sent from Home Assistant. The In-App purchases only apply to the client for Android smartphones, so there isn't any limit when pushing notifications from Home Assistant.

## Services

The following options can be specified inside the data field for the notify service call:

### Service `notify.[name_of_your_tv]`

{% configuration %}

{% endconfiguration %}

This is a fully customized YAML you can use inside `data` to test how the final notification will look like (for using this inside a service call look at the service example at the end of this page):

```yaml
fontsize: "large"
position: "center"
duration: 2
transparency: "0%"
color: "red"
interrupt: 1
```

## Service data for sending images and icons

The following attributes can be placed inside `data` to send images and icons.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `image`                 |      yes | Groups the attributes for image upload. If present, either `url` or `path` have to be provided.
| `icon`                 |      yes | Groups the attributes for icon upload. If present, either `url` or `path` have to be provided.
| `path`                |      yes | Local path of an image file. Is placed inside `image`, `icon` or both.
| `url`                  |      yes | URL of an image file. Is placed inside `image`, `icon` or both.
| `username`             |      yes | Username if the URL requires authentication. Is placed inside `image`, `icon` or both`.
| `password`             |      yes | Password if the URL requires authentication. Is placed inside `image`, `icon` or both.
| `auth`                 |      yes | If set to `digest` HTTP-Digest-Authentication is used. If missing, HTTP-BASIC-Authentication is used and is placed inside `image`, `icon` or both.

Example for posting image from URL:

```yaml
image:
  url: "http://[url to image file]"
  username: "optional user, if necessary"
  password: "optional password, if necessary"
  auth: "digest"
```

Example for posting image from local path:

```yaml
image:
  path: "/path/to/file.ext"
```

Example for posting icon from URL:

```yaml
icon:
  url: "http://[url to image file]"
  username: "optional user, if necessary"
  password: "optional password, if necessary"
  auth: "digest"
```

Example for posting both image and icon from URL:

```yaml
image:
  url: "http://[url to image file]"
  username: "optional user, if necessary"
  password: "optional password, if necessary"
  auth: "digest"
icon:
  url: "http://[url to image file]"
  username: "optional user, if necessary"
  password: "optional password, if necessary"
  auth: "digest"
```

Example of an automation with an service call, full configuration:

{% raw %}

```yaml
service: notify.living_room_tv
data:
  title: "Thanks for the water!"
  message: "Nigel is {{ states('sensor.nigel_moisture') }}% moisture"
  data:
    duration: 4
    position: "bottom-left"
    fontsize: "medium"
    transparency: "75%"
    color: "teal"
    interrupt: 0
```

{% endraw %}

Please note that `path` is validated against the `allowlist_external_dirs` in the `configuration.yaml`.
