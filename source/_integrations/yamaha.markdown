To add a Yamaha Network Receiver to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: yamaha
```
You **must** enable network standby on your receiver, or else startup of Home Assistant will hang if you
have your receiver switched off.

### Supported operations

- Media players created by Yamaha support powering on/off, mute,
  volume control and source selection. Playback controls, for instance
  play and stop are available for sources that supports it.
- The `play_media` action is implemented for `NET RADIO` source
  only. The `media_id` is a `>` separated string of the menu path on
  the vtuner service. For instance `Bookmarks>Internet>WAMC 90.3 FM`.
  MusicCast devices use the path `Radio>Favorites>WAMC 90.3 FM`.

### Example configuration

A full configuration example will look like the sample below:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: yamaha
    host: 192.168.0.10
    source_ignore:
      - "AUX"
      - "HDMI6"
    source_names:
      HDMI1: "ChromeCast"
      AV4: "Vinyl"
    zone_ignore:
      - "Zone_2"
    zone_names:
      Main_Zone: "Family Room"
```

### Example `play_media` script

The `play_media` function can be used in scripts easily to build media
player presets. When done in scripts, the sequence will also allow you
to set volume per source.

```yaml
# Example play_media script
#
# This is for an environment where Zone 2 of the receiver named
# `Living Room Stereo` drives outdoor speakers on the porch.
script:
 rp_porch:
    alias: "Radio Paradise Porch"
    sequence:
      - action: media_player.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.living_room_stereo_zone_2
      - action: media_player.volume_set
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.living_room_stereo_zone_2
        data:
          volume_level: 0.48
      - action: media_player.play_media
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.living_room_stereo_zone_2
        data:
          media_content_type: "NET RADIO"
