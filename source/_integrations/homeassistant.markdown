The **Home Assistant Core** {% term integration %} provides generic implementations like the generic `homeassistant.turn_on` action.

## Editing the General Settings in YAML

The Home Assistant Core integration is also responsible for the general settings. These settings are defined during onboarding, but you can change them later under {% my general title="**Settings** > **System** > **General**" %}. For the detailed steps, refer to [Basic settings](/docs/configuration/basic/).

If you prefer editing in YAML, you can define your general settings in the {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
Note that for some of the settings, these can't be edited from the UI if they were defined in YAML. They will be grayed out or inaccessible.

    Screenshot showing coordinates cannot be edited because they are defined in configuration.yaml file.
</p>

To get started with the general settings in YAML, follow these steps:

1. Copy the following information to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.

    ```yaml
    homeassistant:
      name: Home
      latitude: 32.87336
      longitude: 117.22743
      elevation: 430
      unit_system: metric
      currency: USD
      country: US
      time_zone: "America/Los_Angeles"
      external_url: "https://www.example.com"
      internal_url: "http://homeassistant.local:8123"
      allowlist_external_dirs:
        - "/usr/var/dumping-ground"
        - "/tmp"
      allowlist_external_urls:
        - "http://images.com/image1.png"
      media_dirs:
        media: "/media"
        recordings: "/mnt/recordings"
      debug: false
    ```

2. Edit each entry to fit your home.

  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

## Editing entity settings in YAML

The Home Assistant Core integration is also responsible for entity settings.
By default, all of your devices will be visible and have a default icon determined by their domain. You can customize the look and feel of your front page by altering some of these parameters. This can be done by overriding attributes of specific entities.

Most of these settings can be changed from the UI. For the detailed steps, refer to [Customizing entities](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/).

If you prefer editing in YAML, you can define your general settings in the {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.

### Possible values

{% configuration customize %}
friendly_name:
  description: Name of the entity as displayed in the UI.
  required: false
  type: string
entity_picture:
  description: URL to use as picture for entity.
  required: false
  type: string
icon:
  description: "Any icon from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/). Prefix name with `mdi:`, ie `mdi:home`. Note: Newer icons may not yet be available in the current Home Assistant release."
  required: false
  type: string
assumed_state:
  description: For switches with an assumed state two buttons are shown (turn off, turn on) instead of a switch. By setting `assumed_state` to `false` you will get the default switch icon.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
device_class:
  description: Sets the class of the device, changing the device state and icon that is displayed on the UI (see below). It does not set the `unit_of_measurement`.
  required: false
  type: device_class
  default: None
unit_of_measurement:
  description: Defines the units of measurement, if any. This will also influence the graphical presentation in the history visualization as continuous value. Sensors with missing `unit_of_measurement` are showing as discrete values.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: None
initial_state:
  description: Sets the initial state for automations, `on` or `off`.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: None
{% endconfiguration %}

### Device class

Devices classes categorize certain entities and influence how these are shown in the dashboard. Some device classes categorize by measurement type, such as sensors or binary sensors. Other device classes categorize into more specific types. For example, a cover can be a blind or a curtain. For a given platform, the device class influences what is shown in the user interface. For example: humidifier has two device classes, humidifier and dehumidifier. If the device class is set to `humidifier`, the UI shows **Humidifying**. If it is set to `dehumidifier`, it shows **Drying**.

Device class is currently supported by the following platforms:

- [Binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class)
- [Button](/integrations/button/#device-class)
- [Cover](/integrations/cover/#device-class)
- [Event](/integrations/event/#device-class)
- [Humidifier](/integrations/humidifier/#device-class)
- [Media player](/integrations/media_player/#device-class)
- [Number](/integrations/number/#device-class)
- [Sensor](/integrations/sensor#device-class)
- [Switch](/integrations/switch/#device-class)
- [Update](/integrations/update/#device-class)
- [Valve](/integrations/valve/#device-class)

For a list of the supported device classes, refer to the documentation of the platform.

### Manual customization

{% important %}
If you implement `customize`, `customize_domain`, or `customize_glob`, in your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file, you must make sure it is done inside of `homeassistant:` or it will fail.
{% endimportant %}

```yaml
homeassistant:
  name: Home
  unit_system: metric
  # etc

  customize:
    # Add an entry for each entity that you want to overwrite.
    thermostat.family_room:
      entity_picture: https://example.com/images/nest.jpg
      friendly_name: Nest
    switch.wemo_switch_1:
      friendly_name: Toaster
      entity_picture: /local/toaster.jpg
    switch.wemo_switch_2:
      friendly_name: Kitchen kettle
      icon: mdi:kettle
    switch.rfxtrx_switch:
      assumed_state: false
    media_player.my_media_player:
      source_list:
        - Channel/input from my available sources
  # Customize all entities in a domain
  customize_domain:
    light:
      icon: mdi:home
    automation:
      initial_state: "on"
  # Customize entities matching a pattern
  customize_glob:
    "light.kitchen_*":
      icon: mdi:description
    "scene.month_*_colors":
      icon: mdi:other
```

## Actions

The `homeassistant` integration provides actions for controlling Home Assistant itself, as well as generic controls for any entity.

### Action `homeassistant.check_config`

Reads the configuration files and checks them for correctness, but **does not** load them into Home Assistant. Creates a persistent notification and log entry if errors are found.

### Action `homeassistant.reload_all`

Reload all YAML configuration that can be reloaded without restarting Home Assistant.

It calls the `reload` action on all domains that have it available. Additionally,
it reloads the core configuration (equivalent to calling
`homeassistant.reload_core_config`), themes (`frontend.reload_themes`), and custom Jinja (`homeassistant.reload_custom_templates`).

Prior to reloading, a basic configuration check is performed. If that fails, the reload
will not be performed and will raise an error.

### Action `homeassistant.reload_custom_templates`

Reload all Jinja templates in the `config/custom_templates` directory. Changes to these templates
will take effect the next time an importing template is rendered.

### Action `homeassistant.reload_config_entry`

Reloads an integration config entry.

| Data attribute | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`    | List of entity ids used to reference a config entry.       |
| `area_id`      | List of area ids used to reference a config entry.         |
| `device_id`    | List of device ids used to reference a config entry.       |
| `entry_id`     | A single config entry id used to reference a config entry. |

### Action `homeassistant.reload_core_config`

Reloads the core configuration under `homeassistant:` and all linked files. Once loaded the new configuration is applied. New `customize:` information will be applied the next time the state of the entity gets updated.

### Action `homeassistant.restart`

Restarts the Home Assistant instance (also reloading the configuration on start).

This will also do a configuration check before doing a restart. If the configuration check fails then Home Assistant will not be restarted, instead a persistent notification with the ID `persistent_notification.homeassistant_check_config` will be created. The logs will show details on what failed the configuration check.

### Action `homeassistant.stop`

Stops the Home Assistant instance. Home Assistant must be restarted from the Host device to run again.

### Action `homeassistant.set_location`

Update the location of the Home Assistant default zone (usually "Home").

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                 |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `latitude`     | no       | Latitude of your location.  |
| `longitude`    | no       | Longitude of your location. |
| `elevation`    | yes      | Elevation of your location. |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  action: homeassistant.set_location
  data:
    latitude: 32.87336
    longitude: 117.22743
    elevation: 120
```

### Action `homeassistant.toggle`

Generic action to toggle devices on/off. Same usage as the
`light.toggle`, `switch.toggle`, etc. actions. The difference with this
action compared the others, is that is can be used to mix different domains,
for example, a light and a switch can be toggled in a single action.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                   |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`    | yes      | The entity_id of the device to toggle on/off. |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  action: homeassistant.toggle
  target:
    entity_id: 
      - light.living_room
      - switch.tv
```

### Action `homeassistant.turn_on`

Generic action to toggle devices on. Same usage as the
`light.turn_on`, `switch.turn_on`, etc. actions. The difference with this
action compared the others, is that is can be used to mix different domains,
for example, a light and a switch can be turned on in a single action.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                             |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`    | yes      | The entity_id of the device to turn on. |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  action: homeassistant.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id:
      - light.living_room
      - switch.tv
```

### Action `homeassistant.turn_off` 

Generic action to toggle devices off. Same usage as the
`light.turn_off`, `switch.turn_off`, etc. actions. The difference with this
action compared the others, is that is can be used to mix different domains,
for example, a light and a switch can be turned off in a single action.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                              |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`    | yes      | The entity_id of the device to turn off. |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  action: homeassistant.turn_off
  target:
    entity_id:
      - light.living_room
      - switch.tv
```

### Action `homeassistant.update_entity`

Force one or more entities to update its data rather than wait for the next scheduled update.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                             |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`    | no       | One or multiple entity_ids to update. It can be a list. |

#### Example

```yaml
action:
  action: homeassistant.update_entity
  target:
    entity_id:
    - light.living_room
    - switch.coffe_pot
```

### Action `homeassistant.save_persistent_states`

Save the persistent states (for entities derived from RestoreEntity) immediately.
Maintain the normal periodic saving interval.

Normally these states are saved at startup, every 15 minutes and at shutdown.
