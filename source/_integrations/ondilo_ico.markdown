ICO by [Ondilo](https://ondilo.com/en/) is a small connected device that you simply drop into the pool or spa. ICO continuously analyzes the water quality of your pool/spa and notifies you via its application. ICO provides personalized recommendations so that you use the right products in the right proportions at the right time.

There is currently support for the following information within Home Assistant:

- Water Temperature
- Oxydo Reduction Potential (ORP/Redox)
- pH
- TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) or Salt
- Battery
- RSSI

Sensors will be created for all those data.

## Known limitations

- Recommendations are not yet supported.
