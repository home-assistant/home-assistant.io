The `qld_bushfire` platform lets you integrate a 
GeoRSS feed containing [bushfire alerts](https://www.qfes.qld.gov.au/Current-Incidents) for Queensland. It retrieves alerts from a feed 
and shows information of those alerts filtered by distance to Home Assistant's 
location.

Entities are generated, updated and removed automatically with each update 
from the feed. Each entity defines latitude and longitude and will be shown 
on the default map automatically, or on a map card by defining the source 
`qld_bushfire`. The distance in kilometers is available as the state 
of each entity.

The data is updated every 5 minutes.
