The go2rtc {% term integration %} will connect to a go2rtc instance and will provide a WebRTC proxy for all your cameras.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

If you are running Home Assistant with

- {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}
- {% term "Home Assistant Supervised" %}
- {% term "Home Assistant Container" %}
    
the go2rtc binary is already preinstalled in the container and the config flow will pick it automatically.

If you are running {% term "Home Assistant Core" %}, than you need to setup a go2rtc instance and provide the URL in the config flow.
