The `lifx_cloud` scene {% term integration %} allows you to activate the scenes that LIFX smartphone apps store in the LIFX cloud.

To enable the LIFX Cloud {% term integration %}, add it to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
scene:
  - platform: lifx_cloud
    token: YOUR_LIFX_TOKEN
```

You can then activate each scene with its name from the smartphone app:

```yaml
  - service: scene.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: scene.goodnight
```

{% configuration %}
token:
