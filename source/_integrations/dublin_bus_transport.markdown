The `dublin_bus_transport` {% term integration %} will give you the time until the next two departures from a Dublin bus stop using the RTPI information.

The [Dublin Bus](https://www.dublinbus.ie/RTPI/) website can help to determine the id of your bus stop. You can check if this is correct by going to

https://data.dublinked.ie/cgi-bin/rtpi/realtimebusinformation?stopid=[Stop ID]

Then add the data to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: dublin_bus_transport
    stopid: STOP_ID
```

{% configuration %}
stopid:
  description: The ID of the bus stop to get the information for.

  type: string

The public RTPI information is coming from [Dub Linked](https://data.smartdublin.ie/).
