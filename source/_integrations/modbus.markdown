[modbus](http://www.modbus.org/) is a communication protocol to control PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller) and RTUs (Remote Terminal Unit).

The integration adheres strictly to the [protocol specification](https://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b3.pdf) using [pymodbus](https://github.com/pymodbus-dev/pymodbus) for the protocol implementation.

The modbus {% term integration %} supports all devices adhering to the modbus standard. The communication to the device/devices can be serial (rs-485), TCP, or UDP connections. The modbus integration allows multiple communication channels e.g. a serial port connection combined with one or more TCP connections.

# Configuring modbus communication

Configure the modbus communication with modbus devices. This is a general setup needed establish access to the device.

The modbus integration allows you to use multiple connections each with multiple sensors etc.

The modbus integration provides a number of parameters to help communicate with "difficult" devices, these parameters are independent of the type of communication.

To enable this integration, add it to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

{% configuration %}
delay:
  description: "Time to delay sending messages in seconds after connecting.
  Some modbus devices need a delay of typically 1-2 seconds after connection is established to prepare the communication.
  If a device does not respond to messages after connecting, then try this parameter.
  **Remark:** solely affect the first message."
  required: false
  default: 0
  type: integer
message_wait_milliseconds:
  description: "Time to wait in milliseconds between requests."
  required: false
  default: 30 for serial connection, 0 for all other connections.
  type: integer

    serial:
      description: "Serial connection with RTU framer, used with TTY port or USB rs485 converter."

{% endconfiguration %}

## Configuring tcp connection

`type: tcp` is required. Used for devices providing a TCP/IP interface directly.

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "IP address or name of your modbus device, e.g., `192.168.1.1`."
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: "Network port for the communication."
  required: true
  type: integer

{% endconfiguration %}

### Example: typical tcp configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: typical tcp connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
```

### Example: full tcp configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: full tcp connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    delay: 0
    message_wait_milliseconds: 30
    timeout: 5
```

## Configuring a TCP-RTU connection

`type: rtuovertcp` is required. Used for devices providing a TCP/IP interface directly.

This is typically used, when communicating with a modbus-forwarder, a device that
has a TCP/IP connection upwards, and one or more serial connections downwards. lets also
write more here, to see if the error moves.

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "IP address or name of your modbus device, e.g., `192.168.1.1`."
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: "Network port for the communication."
  required: true
  type: integer

{% endconfiguration %}

### Example: typical TCP-RTU configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: typical tcp-rtu connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: rtuovertcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
```

### Example: full TCP-RTU configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: full tcp-rtu connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: rtuovertcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    delay: 0
    message_wait_milliseconds: 30
    timeout: 5
```

## Configuring a UDP connection

`type: udp` is required. This is rarely used, and only for very special configurations.

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "IP address or name of your modbus device, e.g., `192.168.1.1`."
  required: true
  type: string
port:

  type: integer

{% endconfiguration %}

### Example: typical udp configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: typical udp connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: udp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
```

### Example: full UDP configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: full udp connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: udp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

    delay: 0
    message_wait_milliseconds: 30
    timeout: 5
```

## Configuring serial connection

`type: serial` is required. This is used for devices providing a serial rs485 interface.

The physical interface is typically a USB serial-rs485 converter or an rs232-rs485 connected to a serial port.

{% configuration %}

      description: "6 bit for data, rarely used."
    "7":
      description: "7 bit for data, used for very old devices."
    "8":

  type: list
  keys:
    '1':
      description: "1 stop bit."
    '2':
      description: "2 stop bits, standard."

{% endconfiguration %}

### Example: typical serial configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml:  typical serial connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: serial
    port: /dev/ttyUSB0
    baudrate: 9600
    bytesize: 8
    method: rtu
    parity: E
    stopbits: 1
```

### Example: full serial configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: full udp connection
modbus:

    method: rtu
    parity: E
    stopbits: 1

    delay: 0
    message_wait_milliseconds: 30
    timeout: 5
```


## Configuring multiple connections

Multiple connections can freely mix different communications:

```yaml
# Example yaml: multiple tcp connections
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_1
    port: 2020

  - name: modbus_hub2
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_2
    port: 502
```


```yaml
# Example yaml: tcp connection and serial connection
modbus:
  - name: modbus_hub
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_1
    port: 2020

  - name: modbus_hub2
    type: serial
    port: /dev/ttyUSB0
    baudrate: 9600
    bytesize: 8
    method: rtu
    parity: E
    stopbits: 1
```

# Configuring modbus entities

modbus entities are grouped below each modbus communication entry.

**REMARK** Each modbus device must have at least 1 entity defined, otherwise the integration will not be loaded.

Please refer to [Parameter usage](#parameters-usage-matrix) for conflicting parameters.

All modbus entities have the following parameters:

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: "Address of coil/register."
  required: true
  type: integer
name:
  description: "Name of the entity which must be unique within the entity type."
  required: true
  type: string
scan_interval:
  description: "Update interval in seconds.
  scan_interval = 0 for no polling.
  Entities are read shortly after startup and then according to scan_interval.
  Remark, when restarting HA the last known value is restored."
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 15
slave:
  description: "Identical to `device_address`"
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 0
device_address:
  description: "Id of the device. Used to address multiple devices on a rs485 bus or devices connected to a modbus repeater."
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 0
unique_id:
  description: "ID that uniquely identifies this entity.
  Slaves will be given a unique_id of <<unique_id>>_<<slave_index>>.
  If two enities have the same unique ID, Home Assistant will raise an exception."
  required: false
  type: string

{% endconfiguration %}

## Example: entities grouping

```yaml
# Example yaml: entities grouping
modbus:
  - type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS_1
    port: 2020
    name: "modbus_hub"
    binary_sensors:
      - name: binary_sensor1
        address: 100
    climates:
      - name: "Watlow F4T"
        address: 200
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        address: 300
    fans:
      - name: Fan1
        address: 400
    lights:
      - name: light1
        address: 500
    sensors:
      - name: sensor1
        address: 600
    switches:
      - name: Switch1
        address: 700
```

The different types of entities are detailed in the following.

## Configuring binary sensor entities

The Modbus binary sensor allows you to gather data from coils which as per standard have state ON/OFF.

Normally, a register contains 16 coils, giving different addresses depending on the request used.

```yaml
Register 512: Coil 1 - 16
Register 513: Coil 17 - 32
```

`input_type: coils` would use addresses from 1 through 32, while `input_type: input` would use addresses 512 and 513.
For that reason, many devices (especially older ones) do not share the coil address space with the register address space,
and this `input` would read from a different address space than `coil`. The problem is present in devices with
shared address space and are a frequent cause of problems when configuring entities.

Please refer to [Parameter usage](#parameters-usage-matrix) for conflicting parameters.

{% configuration %}
binary_sensors:
  description: "A list of all binary sensors configured for this connection."
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    device_class:
      description: "The [type/class](/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class) to be used for the UI."
      required: false
      type: string
    input_type:
      description: "Type of request `discrete_input`, `coil`, `holding` or `input`"
      required: false
      default: coil
      type: string
    slave_count:
      description: "Identical to `virtual_count`."
      required: false
      type: integer
    virtual_count:
      description: "Generate count+1 binary sensors (master + slaves).
      Addresses are automatically incremented.
      The parameter simplifies configuration and provides a much better performance by not using count+1 requests but a single request."
      required: false
      type: integer
    unique_id:
      description: "ID that uniquely identifies the entity. Slaves will automatically be given a unique_id of <<unique_id>>_<<slave_index>>.  If two sensors have the same unique ID, Home Assistant will raise an exception."
      required: false
      type: string

{% endconfiguration %}

### Example: typical binary sensor configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: typical binary_sensor
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    binary_sensors:
      - name: my_relay
        address: 100
        slave: 1
```

### Example: full binary sensor configuration

```yaml
# Example yaml: binary_sensor with all options
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    binary_sensors:
      - name: my_relay
        address: 100
        device_class: door
        input_type: coil
        scan_interval: 15
        slave: 1
        slave_count: 0
        unique_id: my_relay
```

### Example: multiple identical binary sensor configuration

```yaml
# Example of 10 identical binary_sensor
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    binary_sensors:
      - name: my_relay
        address: 100
        slave: 1
        slave_count: 10
        unique_id: my_relay
```

This configuration will poll coil addresses 100 to 110 every 15 seconds and update the binary_sensors: `my_relay`
and `my_relay_1` to `my_relay_10`.

The master configuration like device_class are automatically copied to the slaves.

## Configuring climate entities

## Configuring cover entities

The `modbus` cover platform allows you to control covers (such as blinds, a roller shutter, or a garage door).

At the moment, platform cover support the opening and closing of a cover. You can control your covers either using coils or holding registers.

Cover that uses `input_type: coil` is not able to determine intermediary states such as opening and closing. Coil stores only two states — "0" means cover closed, and "1" implies cover open. To allow detecting intermediary states, there is an optional `status_register` attribute. It will enable you to write your command (e.g., to open a cover) into a coil, and read current cover status back through the register. Additionally, you can specify values for `state_open`, `state_opening`, `state_closed`, and `state_closing` attributes. These will be matched with the value read from the `status_register`.

If your cover uses `input_type: holding` (default) to send commands, it can also read the intermediary states. To adjust which value represents what state, you can fine-tune the optional state attributes, like `state_open`. These optional state values are also used for specifying values written into the register. If you specify an optional status_register attribute, cover states will be read from status_register instead of the register used for sending commands.

Please refer to [Parameter usage](#parameters-usage-matrix) for conflicting parameters.

### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a coil

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Intermediary states like opening/closing are not supported. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1

        slave: 2
        coil: 2
        device_class: door
        scan_interval: 10
```

### Example: Modbus cover controlled by a coil, its state is read from the register

This example shows a configuration for a Modbus cover controlled using a coil. Actual cover state is read from the `status_register`. We've also specified register values to match with the states open/opening/closed/closing. The cover state is polled from Modbus every 10 seconds.

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: hub1
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    covers:
      - name: Door1
        slave: 1

# modbus services

The modbus integration provides two generic write services in addition to the platform-specific services.

| Service               | Description                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| modbus.write_register | Write register or registers |
| modbus.write_coil     | Write coil or coils         |

Description:

| Attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hub       | Hub name (defaults to 'modbus_hub' when omitted)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| address   | Address of the Register (e.g. 138)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| value     | (write_register) A single value or an array of 16-bit values. Single value will call modbus function code 0x06. Array will call modbus function code 0x10. Values might need reverse ordering. E.g., to set 0x0004 you might need to set `[4,0]`, this depend on the byte order of your CPU |
| state     | (write_coil) A single boolean or an array of booleans. Single boolean will call modbus function code 0x05. Array will call modbus function code 0x0F                                                                                                                                        |

The modbus integration also provides communication stop/restart services. These services will not do any reconfiguring, but simply stop/start the modbus communication layer.

| Service        | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| modbus.stop    | Stop communication                            |
| modbus.restart | Restart communication (Stop first if running) |

Description:

| Attribute | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| hub       | Hub name (defaults to 'modbus_hub' when omitted) |

## Example: writing a float32 type register

To write a float32 datatype register use network format like `10.0` == `0x41200000` (network order float hexadecimal).

```yaml
service: modbus.write_register
data:
  address: <target register address>
  slave: <target slave address>
  hub: <hub name>
  value: [0x4120, 0x0000]
```

## Service `modbus.set-temperature`

| Service         | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| set_temperature | Set temperature. Requires `value` to be passed in, which is the desired target temperature. `value` should be in the same type as `data_type` |

## Service `modbus.set_hvac_mode`

| Service       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| set_hvac_mode | Set HVAC mode. Requires `value` to be passed in, which is the desired mode. `value` should be a valid HVAC mode. A mapping between the desired state and the value to be written to the HVAC mode register must exist. Calling this service will also set the On/Off register to an appropriate value, if such a register is defined. |


# Opening an issue

When opening an issue, please add your current configuration (or a scaled down version), with at least:

 - the modbus configuration lines
 - the entity (sensor, etc.) lines

In order for the developers better to identify the problem, please add the
following lines to {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.modbus: debug
    pymodbus: debug
```

and restart Home Assistant, reproduce the problem, and include the log in the issue.

# Building on top of modbus

The only recommended way is to inherit the entities needed.
