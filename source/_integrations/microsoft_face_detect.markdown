The `microsoft_face_detect` image processing {% term integration %} allows you to use the
[Microsoft Face Identify](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/)
API through Home Assistant. This platform enables you to detect face on camera
and fire an event with attributes.

Please refer to the [Microsoft Face integration](/integrations/microsoft_face/) configuration on
how to setup the API key.

For using the result inside an automation rule,
take a look at the [Image Processing integration](/integrations/image_processing/) page.

{% important %}
The free version of the Microsoft Face identify API limits the number of requests possible per month. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that you limit the `scan_interval` when setting up an instance of this entity as detailed on the main [Image Processing integration](/integrations/image_processing/) page.
