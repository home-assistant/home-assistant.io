[IAMMETER](https://www.iammeter.com/) provides both a bi-directional single-phase energy meter([WEM3080](https://www.iammeter.com/products/single-phase-meter)) and a bi-directional three-phase energy monitor ([WEM3080T](https://www.iammeter.com/products/three-phase-meter)). Both of them can be integrated into Home Assistant.
The [WEM3050T](https://www.iammeter.com/products/3phase-meter-3050t) is the latest three-phase/split-phase meter, released by IAMMETER on Nov 2023.
The WEM3050T provides nearly all of the features the WEM3080T provides, with the exception of the cloud service.
The WEM3050T can be integrated into Home Assistant by [all of the methods](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/four-ways-to-integrate-the-electricity-usage-monitor-iammeter-into-the-home-assistant/485520/) that WEM3080T supports.
Because there is no cloud service by default, the WEM3050T is much cheaper than the WEM3080T.

## Configuration

To use this {% term integration %} in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: iammeter
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_HOST
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your IAMMETER.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: port of your IAMMETER.
  required: false
  default: 80
  type: integer
name:
  description: Name for the sensor entity.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: IamMeter
{% endconfiguration %}
