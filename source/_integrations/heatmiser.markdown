The `heatmiser` climate platform lets you control [Heatmiser DT/DT-E/PRT/PRT-E](https://www.heatmisershop.co.uk/room-thermostats/) thermostats from Heatmiser. The module itself is currently set up to work over a RS232 -> RS485 converter, therefore it connects over IP.

Further work would be required to get this setup to connect over Wi-Fi, but the HeatmiserV3 Python module being used is a full implementation of the V3 protocol.

To set it up, add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: heatmiser
    host: YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
    port: YOUR_PORT
    tstats:
      - id: THERMOSTAT_ID
        name: THERMOSTAT_NAME
```

A single interface can handle up to 32 connected devices.

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your interface.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port that the interface is listening on.
  required: true
  type: string
tstats:
