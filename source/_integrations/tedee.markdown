This integration interacts with your [Tedee](https://tedee.com) locks by communicating with the Tedee bridge through HTTP. The integration will communicate with your lock locally.

## Pre-requisites

- You will need the bridge to add your locks using this integration.
- You need to have the local API enabled.
- The bridge firmware needs to be at least version `2.2.18086` for push updates to work without errors.

If you do not own the bridge, you can still add your locks to Home Assistant through the [HomeKit device integration](/integrations/homekit_controller.markdown). Communication will happen over Bluetooth in that case, and features will be limited.

## Binary sensors

We have three binary sensors: One that indicates whether the battery is currently charging, one indicating if the pull spring is enabled, and one indicating whether the lock is in a "semi-locked" position, meaning the lock has been turned manually and between its normal end positions.

## Sensors

The integration currently offers two sensors: A battery sensor, indicating the charge of your lock, and a "pull spring duration" sensor, indicating how long (in seconds) your latch will stay pulled after a pull operation (if supported).
