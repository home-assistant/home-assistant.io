The HEOS integration adds support for [HEOS](https://www.denon.com/en-gb/category/heos/) capable products, such as speakers, amps, and receivers (Denon and Marantz) into Home Assistant. Features currently include:

- Each device is represented as a media player entity
- View the currently playing media
- Control play mode (play, pause, stop, next and previous), volume, mute and shuffle
- Clear playlist
- Select source from device physical inputs and HEOS favorites
- Create HEOS groups

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

<div class='note info'>
A connection to a single device enables control for all devices on the network. If you have multiple HEOS devices, enter the host of one that is connected to the LAN via wire or has the strongest wireless signal.

## Services

### Service `heos.sign_in`

Use the sign-in service (go to Developer Tools -> Services and then run the `heos.sign_in` with your username and password. Use the "Fill example data" first, then change it with your data. Check the logs right after, there you should see if the sign-in was successful or not) to sign the connected controller into a HEOS account so that it can retrieve and play HEOS favorites and playlists. An error message is logged if sign-in is unsuccessful. Example service data payload:

```yaml
username: "example@example.com"
password: "password"
```

### Service `heos.sign_out`

media_content_id": "1"
```

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                          |

### Service `media_player.join`

Please note that all of the media players need to be HEOS players.

```

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                          |

| `group_members`        | no       | The player entities which will be synced with the playback from `entity_id`.                         |


### Service `media_player.unjoin`

For removing a HEOS player from a group you can use the `media_player.unjoin` service.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `entity_id`            | yes      | Unjoin this media player from any player groups. |

## Notes

- Receivers with multiple zones are represented as a single media player. They will be turned on when playback is started, but cannot be turned off by the integration at this time.
- [Denon AVR](/integrations/denonar/) and HEOS media players can be combined into a [Universal Media Player](/integrations/universal/#denon-avr--heos)

## Troubleshooing

### Debugging

The HEOS integration will log additional information about commands, events, and other messages when the log level is set to `debug`. Add the relevant line below to the {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} to enable debug logging:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.heos: debug
    pyheos: debug
```

### Missing Favorites

If the HEOS controller is not signed in to a HEOS account, HEOS favorites will not be populated in the media player source selection and the service `media_player.play_media` for `favorite` and `playlist` will fail. Additionally, the following warning will be logged at startup:
> IP_ADDRESS is not logged in to a HEOS account and will be unable to retrieve HEOS favorites: Use the 'heos.sign_in' service to sign-in to a HEOS account

To resolve this issue, use the `heos.sign_in` service to sign the controller into an account as documented above. This only needs to be performed once, as the controller will remain signed in while the account credentials are valid.
