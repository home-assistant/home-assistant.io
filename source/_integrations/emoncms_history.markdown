The `emoncms_history` {% term integration %} makes it possible to transfer (write) details collected with Home Assistant to [Emoncms.org](https://emoncms.org/) or your local running Emoncms instance. It will send the data to a specific input node on Emoncms with the entity IDs as a key. Afterwards you can create feeds and dashboards in Emoncms with the collected data.

To use the `emoncms_history` {% term integration %} in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
emoncms_history:
  api_key: YOUR_EMONCMS_WRITE_API_KEY
  url: https://emoncms.org
  inputnode: 19
  whitelist:
    - sensor.owm_temperature
    - sensor.owm_wind_speed
```

To read information from Emoncms to Home Assistant, you can use the [`emoncms`](/integrations/emoncms) integration.
