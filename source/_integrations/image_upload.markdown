The **Image upload** {% term integration %} allows Home Assistant to handle image assets in
Home Assistant, for example, the profile photos of your systems account.

## Configuration

This integration is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the
[`default_config:`](/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration.

If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this
integration manually:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
image_upload:
```
