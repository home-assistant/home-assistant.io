The **Valve** entity in Home Assistant provides an interface to control valves such as water, gas, or air valves.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

## The state of a valve entity

The valve {% term entity %} can have the following states:

- **Open**: The valve is fully open.
- **Opening**: The valve is in the process of opening.
- **Closed**: The valve is fully closed.
- **Closing**: The valve is in the process of closing.
- **Stopped**: The valve has stopped moving before reaching a fully open or closed position.
- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.

## Device class

{% include integrations/device_class_intro.md %}

The following device classes are supported for valves:

- **None**: Generic valve. This is the default and doesn't need to be set.
- **water**: Valve that controls the flow of water through a system.
- **gas**: Valve that controls the flow of gas through a system.

## Actions

### Valve control actions

All valves respond to `valve.open`, `valve.close`, and `valve.toggle`.
Valves that allow setting a specific position may also be controlled with `valve.set_position` and `valve.stop`.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | yes | String or list of strings that point at `entity_id`'s of valves. Use `entity_id: all` to target all.

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "07:15:00"
  action:
    - action: valve.close
      target:
        entity_id: valve.demo
```

### Action `valve.set_position`

Set the position of one or multiple valves if they support setting a specific position.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | yes | String or list of strings that point at `entity_id`'s of valves. Use `entity_id: all` to target all.
| `position` | no | Integer between 0 (fully closed) and 100 (fully open).

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "07:15:00"
  action:
    - action: valve.set_position
      target:
        entity_id: valve.demo
      data:
        position: 50
```
