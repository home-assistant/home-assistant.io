The `met` platform uses the [Met.no](https://met.no/) web service as a source for meteorological data for your location. The weather forecast is delivered by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and the NRK.

To add Met.no to your installation, go to Configuration >> Integrations in the UI and enable the Met.no integration.
