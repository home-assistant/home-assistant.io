The TP-Link Omada SDN Controller integration allows you to control your [TP-Link Omada SDN Devices](https://www.tp-link.com/omada-sdn/) such as network switches, access points, and internet gateways. It requires a local Omada controller (software or hardware controllers) and does not currently support the paid-for TP-Link Omada Cloud Management SAAS Platform.

The integration provides basic configuration and status of Omada devices controlled by the controller. All supported devices connected to the controller will be added to Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

- Host: Enter the URL of the Omada management interface.
- Verify SSL Certificates: Enable to check the validity of the certificate presented by the Omada controller.
- Username/Password: A user account with permissions to view & configure the site is required.

### Multiple Sites

If you have multiple sites managed by your controller, you will be prompted to choose which site to manage.

## Supported Controllers

TP-Link Omada Controller:

- OC200
- OC300
- Software Controller

Controller versions 5.1.0 and later are supported.

## Supported Omada devices

- Firmware Update

### Access Points

- Firmware Update

### Internet Gateways

### Device trackers

The integration can track Wi-Fi devices connected to access points managed by the TP-Link Omada controller. All known Wi-Fi clients will be initially created in a disabled state. You then need to enable the entities that you want to track.

If you want to increase the polling frequency of client updates, follow [these instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval). You only need to request a refresh from one of the tracked devices, all of the tracked devices will be refreshed at the same time.

Note: The TP-Link Omada controller takes a few minutes to detect when a client disconnects from the Wi-Fi network, even with more regular polling updates.
