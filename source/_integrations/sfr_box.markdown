The SFR Box integration offers integration with the **SFR** broadband router.

This integration provides the following platforms:

- Binary sensors - such as ADSL status.
- Buttons - such as reboot.
- Sensors - such as ADSL line status, attenuation, noise and data rate.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Compatibility

The integration uses the REST API, which is known to be available on models `NB4`, `NB5`, `NB6`, `NB6V`, and `NB6VAC`.

However, `NCC` models do not appear to expose this REST API, and are therefore unsupported by the integration.
