The `russound_rnet` {% term integration %} allows you to control Russound devices that make use of the RNET protocol.

This has initially been tested against a Russound CAV6.6 unit with six zones and six sources. It will also work with a Russound CAA66, but be sure to use a null-modem cable. If you have mutiple controllers connected via the RNET link ports, every increment of 6 zones maps to the corresponding controller ID.

Connecting to the Russound device is only possible by TCP, you can make use of a TCP to Serial gateway such as [tcp_serial_redirect](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial/blob/master/examples/tcp_serial_redirect.py)

To add an {% term integration %} to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}
