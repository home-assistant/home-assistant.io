- Epson EH-TW3200

## Configuration

This integration supports connecting to an Epson projector via LAN or Serial.

### LAN connection

Connect the projector to your LAN and enter the IP address of the projector when prompted, selecting either HTTP or TCP depending on what the projector model supports.
The iProjection app by Epson can be used to test if it is working.

### Serial connection

Connect projector directly to Home Assistant via a serial cable, or ser2net can be used as a Serial to network proxy.

#### ser2net configuration

A ser2net configuration similar to below can be used to expose the projector connected to `/dev/ttyUSB0` on port `3629`.

```yaml
connection: &con1
  accepter: tcp,3629
  connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyUSB0,9600n81
```

Then the projector can be added to the integration using  `socket://<ser2net_ip>:3629`.
