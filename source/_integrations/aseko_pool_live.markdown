The Aseko Pool Live integration allows you to monitor your Aseko ASIN Aqua dosing systems.

The integration is fully compatible with ASIN AQUA Net and ASIN AQUA Home.

If you have an ASIN AQUA Oxygen, Home, Salt or Profi dosing system and not all probes are listed in Home Assistant, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml&title=Add%20support%20for%20ASIN%20AQUA%20[your%20device%20model]) and include the first 8 digits of your serial number so that your device model can be made fully compatible with Home Assistant.
