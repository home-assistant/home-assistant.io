The Husqvarna Automower integration provides connectivity with Husqvarna Automowers lawn mowers through Husqvarna's cloud API. Only mowers with *Automower® Connect* or with the *Automower® Connect Module* are supported.

In order to use this integration you must properly configure OAuth2 credentials using your Husqvarna account.  Refer to [this guide](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/docs/get-started) for general overview of the process.
Your Husqvarna account username/password used for the *Automower® Connect*  phone app is required.  Most users probably created a Husqvarna account during initial mower setup.

1. Go to the [Husqvarna Developer Portal](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud) and sign in with your Husqvarna account. Authorize *Developer Portal* to access Husqvarna account when prompted.

2. After signing in you will be automatically redirected to "My applications". (Otherwise go to: [Applications](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/applications))

3. Create a new application:
   - Name is required but can be anything, for example "My Home Assistant"

   - Description is optional

   - Redirect URL: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
     Make sure no extra spaces were appended at end of URL from copy and paste.

   - Click **CREATE**.  *Application Key* and *Application Secret* will be generated and shown.  Protect these like a username and password.

4. Click on **CONNECT NEW API** and connect the **Authentication API**.

### Home Assistant

The My Home Assistant redirect feature needs to be setup to redirect to your Home Assistant installation. See [My FAQ](https://my.home-assistant.io/faq) for additional information.

1. Add the integration to your Home Assistant installation and test the redirect feature by following below link:
   [![my_button](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=husqvarna_automower)

2. Acknowledge prompts to open link, install Husqvarna Automower integration.

3. Acknowledge prompt to setup application credentials.

4. Enter the following from the Husqvarna developer tab:

   - A name of the application
   - Copy and paste the *Application key* into the *OAuth Client ID* field
   - Copy and paste the *Application secret* into the *OAuth Client Secret* field

5. Click **Create**

6. Browser will be redirected to Husqvarna Developer site.  Sign in and Authorize the integration to connect with your Husqvarna account

7. After authorizing the integration the browser will show the My Home Assistant redirect link to link this account.  Click on **Link Account**.

8. Confirm successful connection of mower and assign to an area.

## Troubleshooting

If you have an error with your credentials, you can delete them on the [application credentials](/integrations/application_credentials/) page.

## Entities

Once you have enabled the Husqvarna Automower integration, you should see the following entities:

### Binary sensor

The integration will create the following binary sensors:

- Battery charging  
  *The mower is currently charging. It reports this state if it autonomously returned to the dock due to low battery and if it leaves the dock for mowing after being fully charged.*
- Leaving dock  
  *The mower is currently leaving the charging station and heading out to a starting point.*
- Returning to dock  
  *The mower is on its way home to the charging station.*

### Button (if available)

The integration will create a button entity for confirming minor mower errors.

### Device tracker (if available)

The integration will create a device tracker entity to show the position of the mower.

### Lawn mower

The integration will create a lawn mower entity to control the mower. This entity can:

- Resume the schedule
- Pause mowing
- Park until next schedule

### Number (if available)

#### Cutting height

The integration will create a number entity for changing the cutting height of the mower. This entity is disabled by default. You have to enable it manually. It can't be detected with the API if the mower has the capability to change the cutting height remotely. Before enabling this function, refer to the mower documentation. Depending on the mower, it is possible that you can use this entity only passively as a sensor and not actively to change the cutting height.
Possible values are 1 (grass stays short) to 9 (grass stays high).

#### Cutting height for work areas

The integration will create a number entity for changing the cutting height for each work area of the mower if your mower supports work areas. Possible values for the cutting heights are 0% (grass stays short) to 100% (grass stays high) of the default cutting height. Note: It's not yet possible to change the default cutting height with Home Assistant.

### Select (if available)

The integration will create a select entity for selecting the headlight mode of the mower.

### Sensor

The integration will create the following sensors:

- Battery level
- Cutting blade usage time (if available)
- Error. For example: *Mower tilted*, *outside geofence*.
- Restricted reason. For example: *Week schedule*, *frost*, or *daily limit*.
- Mode
- Next start
- Number of charging cycles
- Number of collisions
- Total charging time
- Total cutting time
- Total drive distance
- Total running time
- Total searching time
- Work area (if available). For example: *My lawn*, *Front lawn*, *Back lawn*

### Switch

#### Avoid (if available)

The integration will create a switch for each stay-out zone defined for your mower. When the switch is on, the mower avoids the corresponding zone. When the switch is off, the mower enters the corresponding zone.

#### Enable schedule

The integration will create a switch to enable or disable the schedule of the mower. If the switch is on, the mower will mow according to the schedule. If the switch is off the mower will return to the dock and park until further notice.

## Actions

The integration offers the following actions:

### Override schedule

With this action, you can let your mower mow or park for a given time. You can select the override mode with the `override_mode´ attribute. This will override all your schedules during this time. The duration can be given in days, hours and/or minutes. The values for the duration have to be between 1 minute and 42 days. Seconds will be ignored.

```yaml
# Replace <name> with the name of your mower.
action: husqvarna_automower.override_schedule
target:
  entity_id: lawn_mower.<name>
data:
  duration:
    days: 1
    hours: 12
    minutes: 30
  override_mode: mow  ### alternative: `park`
```

### Override schedule work area (if available)

With this action, you can let your mower mow for a given time in a certain work area. You can enter the work area with the `work_area_id` attribute. You can get the `work_area_id` from the `Work area` sensor.
![Work area sensor](/images/integrations/husqvarna_automower/work_area_sensor.png)
This will override all your schedules during this time. The duration can be given in days, hours, and/or minutes. The values for the duration have to be between 1 minute and 42 days. Seconds will be ignored.

```yaml
# Replace <name> with the name of your mower.
service: husqvarna_automower.override_schedule
target:
  entity_id: lawn_mower.<name>
data:
  duration:
    days: 1
    hours: 12
    minutes: 30
  work_area_id: 123456 ### Work area ID for the "Front lawn" from the example above.
```
