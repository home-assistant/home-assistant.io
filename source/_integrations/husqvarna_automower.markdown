The Husqvarna Automower integration provides connectivity with Husqvarna Automowers lawn mowers through Husqvarna's cloud API. Only mowers with *Automower® Connect* or with the *Automower® Connect Module* are supported.

In order to use this integration you must properly configure OAuth2 credentials using your Husqvarna account.  Refer to [this guide](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/docs/get-started) for general overview of the process.
Your Husqvarna account username/password used for the *Automower® Connect*  phone app is required.  Most users probably created a Husqvarna account during initial mower setup.

1. Go to the [Husqvarna Developer Portal](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud) and sign in with your Husqvarna account. Authorize *Developer Portal* to access Husqvarna account when prompted.

2. After signing in you will be automatically redirected to "My applications". (Otherwise go to: [Applications](https://developer.husqvarnagroup.cloud/applications))

3. Create a new application:
   - Name is required but can be anything, for example "My Home Assistant"

   - Description is optional

   - Redirect URL: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
     Make sure no extra spaces were appended at end of URL from copy and paste.

## Entities

Once you have enabled the Husqvarna Automower integration, you should see the following entities:

### Lawn Mower

The integration will create a lawn mower entity to control the mower. This entity can:

- Resume the schedule
- Pause mowing
- Park until next schedule

### Sensor

The integration will create the following sensors:

- Battery level
- Cutting blade usage time (if available)
- Mode
- Next start
- Number of charging cycles
- Number of collisions
- Total charging time
- Total cutting time
- Total drive distance
- Total running time
- Total searching time

### Switch

The integration will create a switch to enable or disable the schedule of the mower. If the switch is on, the mower will mow according to the schedule. If the switch is off the mower will return to the dock and park until further notice.
