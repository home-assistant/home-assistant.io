The **UPnP/IGD** {% term integration %} enables you to collect network statistics from your router such as bytes in/out and packets in/out, uptime, WAN IP address, and WAN connectivity status. This information is provided by the [UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play)/[Internet Gateway Device (IGD) Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol) if enabled on your router.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Binary Sensor** - If router is connected to the WAN.
- **Sensor** - Allows to get the network statistics from your router such as bytes in/out and packets in/out, uptime, status, and IP. Sensor for uptime will only be there if supported by the router.

Please note that UPnP or NAT-PMP needs to be enabled on your router for this {% term integration %} to work.

## Debugging integration

If you have problems with this {% term integration %} you can add debug prints to the log.

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.upnp: debug
    async_upnp_client: debug
    async_upnp_client.traffic: error
```

When creating an issue, please include the (relevant) logging with the issue. Any sensitive information such as IPs can be obfuscated.
