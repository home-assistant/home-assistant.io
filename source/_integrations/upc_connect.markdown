The `upc_connect` platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a [Connect Box](https://www.upc.ch/en/internet/learn-about-internet/) from [Liberty Global](https://www.libertyglobal.com) (also known as UPC Cablecom in Switzerland) which is an Internet provider in Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands (under Ziggo) and Hungary (under Vodafone).

<div class='note'>
This integration works by logging into the router with a password. The router can only have one active session at any time, so if you want to access your router settings then stop Home Assistant first.
</div>

To use a Connect Box in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: upc_connect
    password: PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
password:

  required: true
  type: string
host:
  description: The IP address of your router.
  required: false
  default: 192.168.0.1
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.
