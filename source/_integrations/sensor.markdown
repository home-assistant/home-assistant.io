Sensors are a basic integration in Home Assistant. They monitor the states and conditions of a variety of entities. An entity can be many things. This can include a physical device like a motion sensor that reports the battery level, a web service that retrieves the weather temperature, a built-in function that calculates the sun's elevation relative to your GPS position, or even a custom sensor you may have created to report the free space on your laptop. These are all _things_ reporting different types of information.

Some of these sensors are built-in to Home Assistant, some are created automatically when you add an integration (see this [list](/integrations/#sensor)), and some can be created manually. The [Statistics](/integrations/statistics) and [Template](/integrations/template) sensors are two examples of the last case.

## The state of a sensor entity

The state of a sensor entity is its currently detected value, which can be either text or a number.

In addition, the entity can have the following states:

- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.
