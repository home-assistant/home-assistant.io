The `usgs_earthquakes_feed` platform lets you integrate a GeoJSON feed provided by the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) with information about seismic events like earthquakes. It retrieves incidents from a feed and shows information of those incidents filtered by distance to Home Assistant's location.

</p>

Entities are generated, updated and removed automatically with each update from the feed. Each entity defines latitude and longitude and will be shown on the map automatically. The distance in kilometers is available as the state of each entity.

The data is updated every 5 minutes.

## Configuration

To integrate the U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program feed, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
geo_location:
  - platform: usgs_earthquakes_feed
    feed_type: "past_day_all_earthquakes"
```

{% configuration %}
feed_type:
  description: The U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program provides 20 feeds covering different timeframes and magnitudes. You must select one of the feed types listed below.
  type: string
  required: true
minimum_magnitude:
  description: The minimum magnitude of an earthquake to be included.
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 0.0
radius:
  description: The distance in kilometers around Home Assistant's coordinates in which seismic events are included.
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 50.0
latitude:
  description: Latitude of the coordinates around which events are considered.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Latitude defined in your `configuration.yaml`
longitude:
  description: Longitude of the coordinates around which events are considered.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Longitude defined in your `configuration.yaml`
{% endconfiguration %}

## State Attributes

The following state attributes are available for each entity in addition to the standard ones:

| Attribute          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| latitude           | Latitude of the earthquake. |
| longitude          | Longitude of the earthquake. |
| source             | `usgs_earthquakes_feed` to be used in conjunction with `geo_location` automation trigger. |
| external_id        | The external ID used in the feed to identify the earthquake in the feed. |
| place              | Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. |
| magnitude          | Reported magnitude of the earthquake. |
| time               | Date and time when this event occurred. |
