The `usgs_earthquakes_feed` platform lets you integrate a GeoJSON feed provided by the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) with information about seismic events like earthquakes. It retrieves incidents from a feed and shows information of those incidents filtered by distance to Home Assistant's location.

</p>

Entities are generated, updated and removed automatically with each update from the feed. Each {% term entity %} defines latitude and longitude and will be shown on the map automatically. The distance in kilometers is available as the state of each {% term entity %}.

The data is updated every 5 minutes.

## Configuration

To integrate the U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program feed, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
geo_location:
  - platform: usgs_earthquakes_feed
    feed_type: "past_day_all_earthquakes"
```

{% configuration %}
feed_type:
  description: The U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Hazards Program provides 20 feeds covering different timeframes and magnitudes. You must select one of the feed types listed below.
  type: string
  required: true
minimum_magnitude:
  description: The minimum magnitude of an earthquake to be included.
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 0.0
radius:
  description: The distance in kilometers around Home Assistant's coordinates in which seismic events are included.
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 50.0
latitude:
  description: Latitude of the coordinates around which events are considered.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Latitude defined in your `configuration.yaml`
longitude:
  description: Longitude of the coordinates around which events are considered.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: Longitude defined in your `configuration.yaml`
{% endconfiguration %}

## State attributes

The following state attributes are available for each {% term entity %} in addition to the standard ones:

| Attribute          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| latitude           | Latitude of the earthquake. |
| longitude          | Longitude of the earthquake. |
| source             | `usgs_earthquakes_feed` to be used in conjunction with `geo_location` automation trigger. |
| external_id        | The external ID used in the feed to identify the earthquake in the feed. |
| place              | Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. |
| magnitude          | Reported magnitude of the earthquake. |
| time               | Date and time when this event occurred. |
