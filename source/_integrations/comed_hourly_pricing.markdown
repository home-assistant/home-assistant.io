The ComEd Hourly Pricing program is an optional program available to ComEd electric subscribers which charges customers a variable rate for electricity supply based on current demand rather than a traditional fixed rate. Live prices are published [here](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/live-prices/) and also via an [API](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/hp-api/) which we can integrate as a sensor in Home Assistant.

There are two price feeds available: the 5-minute price and current hour average price.

To use this sensor in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml

  - platform: comed_hourly_pricing
