The ComEd Hourly Pricing program is an optional program available to ComEd electric subscribers which charges customers a variable rate for electricity supply based on current demand rather than a traditional fixed rate. Live prices are published [here](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/live-prices/) and also via an [API](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/hp-api/) which we can integrate as a sensor in Home Assistant.

There are two price feeds available: the 5-minute price and current hour average price.

To use this sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: comed_hourly_pricing
    monitored_feeds:
      - type: five_minute
      - type: current_hour_average
```
