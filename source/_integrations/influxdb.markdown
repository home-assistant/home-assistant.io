The `influxdb` integration makes it possible to transfer all state changes to an external [InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/) database. See the [official installation documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/introduction/installation/) for how to set up an InfluxDB database, or [there is a community add-on](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/community-hass-io-add-on-influxdb/54491) available.

Additionally, you can now make use of an InfluxDB 2.0 installation with this integration. See the [official installation instructions](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/) for how to set up an InfluxDB 2.0 database. Or you can sign up for their [cloud service](https://cloud2.influxdata.com/signup) and connect Home Assistant to that. Note that the configuration is significantly different for a 2.xx installation, the documentation below will note when fields or defaults apply to only a 1.xx installation or a 2.xx installation.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Sensor](#sensor)

<div class='note'>

The `influxdb` database integration runs parallel to the Home Assistant database. It does not replace it.

</div>

## Configuration

The default InfluxDB configuration doesn't enforce authentication. If you have installed InfluxDB on the same host where Home Assistant is running and haven't made any configuration changes, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
influxdb:
```

You will still need to create a database named `home_assistant` via InfluxDB's command-line interface. For instructions on how to create a database check the [InfluxDB documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/introduction/getting_started/#creating-a-database) relevant to the version you have installed.

## Configure Filter

By default, no entity will be excluded. To limit which entities are being exposed to `InfluxDB`, you can use the `include` and `exclude` parameters.

```yaml
# Example filter to include specified domains and exclude specified entities
influxdb:
  include:
    domains:
      - alarm_control_panel
      - light
    entity_globs:
      - binary_sensor.*_occupancy
  exclude:
    entities:
      - light.kitchen_light
```

Filters are applied as follows:

1. No includes or excludes - pass all entities
2. Includes, no excludes - only include specified entities
3. Excludes, no includes - only exclude specified entities
4. Both includes and excludes:
   - Include domain and/or glob patterns specified
      - If domain is included, and entity not excluded or match exclude glob pattern, pass
      - If entity matches include glob pattern, and entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
      - If domain is not included, glob pattern does not match, and entity not included, fail
   - Exclude domain and/or glob patterns specified and include does not list domains or glob patterns
      - If domain is excluded and entity not included, fail
      - If entity matches exclude glob pattern and entity not included, fail
      - If entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
   - Neither include or exclude specifies domains or glob patterns
      - If entity is included, pass (as #2 above)
      - If entity include and exclude, the entity exclude is ignored

## Examples

  ssl: false
  host: localhost
  port: 9999
  token: GENERATED_AUTH_TOKEN
  organization: RANDOM_16_DIGIT_HEX_ID

  include:
    domains:
      - sensor
      - binary_sensor
      - sun
    entities:
      - weather.home
```

## Sensor

The `influxdb` sensor allows you to use values from an [InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/) database to populate a sensor state. This can be used to present statistics as Home Assistant sensors, if used with the `influxdb` history component. It can also be used with an external data source.

<div class='note'>

  You must configure the `influxdb` history component in order to create `influxdb` sensors. If you just want to create sensors for an external InfluxDB database and you don't want Home Assistant to write any data to it you can exclude all entities like this:

```yaml
influxdb:
  exclude:
    entity_globs: "*"
```

</div>

### Configuration

To configure this sensor, you need to define the sensor connection variables and a list of queries to your `configuration.yaml` file. A sensor will be created for each query:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: influxdb
    queries:
      - name: mean value of foo
        where: '"name" = ''foo'''
        measurement: '"°C"'
```

Note that 2.xx installations of InfluxDB only support queries in their Flux language. While this language was available in 1.xx installations, it was not the default and not used in the API so you may not be aware of it. You can learn more about it from their [documentation](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/reference/flux/) or by using the query builder in the UI. 

You will need to construct your queries in this language in sensors for 2.xx installations, it looks like this:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor: 
  - platform: influxdb
    api_version: 2
    organization: RANDOM_16_DIGIT_HEX_ID
    token: GENERATED_AUTH_TOKEN
    queries_flux: 
      - group_function: mean
        imports: 
          - strings
        name: "Mean humidity reported from past day"
        query: >
          filter(fn: (r) => r._field == "value" and r.domain == "sensor" and strings.containsStr(v: r.entity_id, substr: "humidity"))
          |> keep(columns: ["_value"])

```

{% raw %}

```yaml

        group_function: mean
```

{% endraw %}

Note that when working with Flux queries, the resultset is broken into tables, you can see how this works in the Data Explorer of the UI. If you are operating on data created by the InfluxDB history component, this means by default, you will have a table for each entity and each attribute of each entity (other then `unit_of_measurement` and any others you promoted to tags).

This is a lot more tables compared to 1.xx queries, where you essentially had one table per `unit_of_measurement` across all entities. You can still create aggregate metrics across multiple sensors though. As you can see in the example above, a good way to do this is with the [keep](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/transformations/keep/) or [drop](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/transformations/drop/) filters. When you remove key columns Influx merges tables, allowing you to make many tables that share a schema for `_value` into one.

## Querying your data in Influx

### Sensors

For sensors with a unit of measurement defined the unit of measurement is used as the measurement name and entries are tagged with the second part of the `entity_id`. Therefore you need to add a WHERE clause to the query to filter out values. 

For example a query on a `%` battery for `sensor.multi_sensor_battery_level`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "%" WHERE time > now() - 12h AND "entity_id" = 'multi_sensor_battery_level';
```

Or for temperatures represented in `°C`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "°C" WHERE time > now() - 1h;
```

### Everything else

Everything else can be queried using the `entity_id` as its measurement name.

```sql
SELECT * FROM "binary_sensor.front_doorbell" WHERE time > now() - 24h;
```

```sql
SELECT "temperature" FROM "climate.kitchen" WHERE time > now() - 24h;
```
