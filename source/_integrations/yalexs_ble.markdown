Integrates [Yale Access](https://www.yalehome.com/us/en/products/smart-technology/yale-access) Bluetooth devices into Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The **Yale Access Bluetooth** {% term integration %} will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional.

Devices must have a Yale Access module installed to function with this {% term integration %} if one is not already built-in.

## Limited support devices

These devices do not send updates, but can be locked and unlocked.

- MD-04I (Yale Conexis L1, Yale Conexis L2)
- YRCB-490 (Yale Smart Cabinet Lock)

## Troubleshooting

Lock operation requires setting up an encrypted connection highly sensitive to latency. It is recommended to use a [High-Performance Bluetooth adapter](/integrations/bluetooth/#known-working-high-performance-adapters) or [ESPHome Bluetooth proxy](/integrations/bluetooth/#remote-adapters-bluetooth-proxies) for stable operation.

## Push updates

Some locks only send push updates when they have an active HomeKit pairing. If your lock is not sending push updates, ensure it's paired with a HomeKit using an iOS device or the HomeKit controller {% term integration %}. The lock cannot be paired via HomeKit Controller and the Yale Access Bluetooth {% term integration %} on the same Home Assistant instance as they will both try to access the lock simultaneously and fail.

One easy way to fix this is to create a new/second home in the Apple Home app and add the lock to that new home. Push updates should occur as intended after the lock is added.

Alternatively, call the `homeassistant.update_entity` service to force the {% term integration %} to update the lock state, or enable the always connected option.

{% include integrations/option_flow.md %}

If the lock does not support push updates via advertisements or you want lock operation to be more responsive, you can enable always connected mode. Always connected will cause the lock to stay connected to Home Assistant via Bluetooth, which will use more battery.

## Door sensors

The lock must be calibrated in the Yale Access App for the door sensors to function correctly. If the door sensor has an unknown state or is not updating, try recalibrating the lock in the app.

## Obtaining the offline key

The offline key and slot number are required to operate the lock. These credentials can be found in multiple places depending on the lock brand and model.

### Yale Access, Yale Home, or August Cloud

The [August](/integrations/august) {% term integration %} can automatically provision the offline key if the configured account has the key loaded. You may need to create or use a non-primary existing account with owner-level access to the lock, as not all accounts will have the key loaded. If the lock was not discovered by Home Assistant when the cloud {% term integration %} was loaded, reload the cloud {% term integration %} once the lock has been discovered.

If the offline key can automatically be provisioned, you will not be asked to enter it and the {% term integration %} should be automatically added, configured and running.

Most Yale branded locks can use the August cloud to obtain the keys. Accessing the August cloud to receive the key may not work unless the lock was purchased in a market that sells under both brands.

### iOS - Yale Access App or August App

The iOS app will only save the offline key to your device's filesystem if Auto-Unlock has been enabled and used at least once. Auto-Unlock can be disabled once the key has been loaded.

- Using [iMazing](https://imazing.com/) or [iPhone Backup Extractor](https://www.iphonebackupextractor.com/), find the backup files for the Yale Access app.
- Look in the `Library/Preferences` `.plist` files for the Yale Access app and find the one with the value of `key` and `slot` using `Xcode` or any binary `plist` viewer.

### Android - Yale Access App or August App

The Android app will only save the offline key to your device's filesystem if Auto-Unlock has been enabled and used at least once. Auto-Unlock can be disabled once the key has been loaded.

Root access is required to read the `key` and `slot` stored in `/data/data/com.august.luna/shared_prefs/PeripheralInfoCache.xml`

### Android - Yale Home

The Android app will only save the offline key to your device's filesystem if Auto-Unlock has been enabled and used at least once. Auto-Unlock can be disabled once the key has been loaded.

Root access is required to copy the `ModelDatabase.sql` from `/data/data/com.assaabloy.yale/databases`. Once copied, you can use [DB Broser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to open the `ModelDatabase.sql`, navigate to the table `LockData` and find the column `offlineKeys`.There, you will find a JSON that includes the `key` and `slot` properties.

## Troubleshooting

### Lock frequently requires re-authentication

If you use the key from an iOS or Android device that you also frequently use to operate the lock, you may find that the key is rotated, and the integration can no longer authenticate. If you are using the [August](/integrations/august) integration to keep the key up to date, it may need to be reloaded to update the key. 

To avoid the problem, create a second owner account in the August app, log in to it once on your iOS or Android device, operate the locks, log out of the account, remove the August integration, and set up the August integration with the secondary owner account. This method avoids the problem because there is no longer an iOS or Android device logged into the secondary owner account that can rotate the key unexpectedly.
