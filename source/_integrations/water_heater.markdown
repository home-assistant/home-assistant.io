The **Water heater** {% term integration %} is built for the controlling and monitoring of hot water heaters.

To enable this {% term integration %}, pick one of the platforms, and add it to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
water_heater:
  platform: demo
```

## The state of a water heater entity

A water heater entity can have the following states:

- **Eco**: Energy efficient mode, provides energy savings and fast heating.
- **Electric**: Electric only mode. This mode uses the most energy.
- **Performance**: High performance mode.
- **High demand**: Meet high demands when the water heater is undersized.
- **Heat pump**: Heat pump is the slowest to heat, but it uses less energy.
- **Gas**: Gas only mode. This mode uses the most energy.
- **Off**: The water heater is off.
- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.

## Actions

### Water heater control actions

Available actions: `water_heater.set_temperature`, `water_heater.turn_away_mode_on`, `water_heater.turn_away_mode_off`, `water_heater.set_operation_mode`, `water_heater.turn_on`, `water_heater.turn_off`

{% tip %}
Not all water heater actions may be available for your platform. Be sure to check the available actions Home Assistant has enabled by checking **Developer Tools** > **Actions**.
{% endtip %}

### Action `water_heater.set_temperature`

Sets target temperature of water heater device.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | yes | String or list of strings that point at the `entity_id` of water heater devices to control. Use `entity_id: all` to target all. |
| `temperature` | no | New target temperature for water heater |
| `operation_mode` | yes | Operation mode to set the temperature to. This defaults to current_operation mode if not set, or set incorrectly. For a list of possible modes, refer to the {% term integration %} documentation. |

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "07:15:00"
  action:
    - action: water_heater.set_temperature
      target:
        entity_id: water_heater.demo
      data:
        temperature: 24
        operation_mode: eco
```

### Action `water_heater.set_operation_mode`

Set operation mode for water heater device

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | yes | String or list of strings that point at the `entity_id` of water heater devices to control. Use `entity_id: all` to target all. |
| `operation_mode` | no | New value of operation mode. For a list of possible modes, refer to the integration documentation. |

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "07:15:00"
  action:
    - action: water_heater.set_operation_mode
      target:
        entity_id: water_heater.demo
      data:
        operation_mode: eco
```

### Action `water_heater.set_away_mode`

Turn away mode on or off for water heater device

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | yes | String or list of strings that point at the `entity_id` of water heater devices to control. Use `entity_id: all` to target all. |
| `away_mode` | no | New value of away mode. 'on'/'off' or True/False |

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: "07:15:00"
  action:
    - action: water_heater.set_away_mode
      target:
        entity_id: water_heater.demo
      data:
        away_mode: true
```

### Action `water_heater.turn_on`

Turn water heater device on.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | yes | String or list of strings that define the entity ID(s) of water heater device(s) to control. To target all water heater devices, use `all`. |

### Action `water_heater.turn_off`

Turn water heater device off.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
