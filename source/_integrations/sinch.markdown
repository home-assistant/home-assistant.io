The `sinch` platform uses [Sinch](https://www.sinch.com/products/messaging/sms/) to deliver notifications from Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

Go to your [Sinch Dashboard](https://dashboard.sinch.com/sms/api/rest) and click "Add new REST API". You should now be able to obtain your `service_plan_id` and `api_key`.

## Configuration

To add Sinch to your installation, add the following to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - platform: sinch
    service_plan_id: SINCH_SERVICE_PLAN_ID
    api_key: SINCH_API_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: "Setting the optional parameter name allows multiple notifiers to be created. The default value is `Sinch`. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`."
