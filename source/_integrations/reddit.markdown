The Reddit sensor integrates data from [Reddit](https://reddit.com/) to monitor your favorite subreddits.

## Setup

To set up this sensor, you will need to generate a `client_id` and `client_secret` for the user account you will use to connect. Follow the first steps in [this Wiki page](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example).

<div class='note'>
This integration does not support Reddit's two-factor authentication. If you use two-factor authentication for your Reddit account, create a separate Reddit account without two-factor authentication for use with Home Assistant.

## Configuration
