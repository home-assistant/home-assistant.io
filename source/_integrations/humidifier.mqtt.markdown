The `mqtt` humidifier platform lets you control your MQTT enabled humidifiers.

## Configuration

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a `state_topic` to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT humidifier will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the humidifier will be `unknown`. A MQTT device can reset the current state to `unknown` using a `None` payload.

When a `state_topic` is not available, the humidifier will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the humidifier will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the humidifier will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`). The initial state is set to `False` / `off` in optimistic mode.

Optimistic mode can be forced even if a `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it if you are experiencing incorrect humidifier operation.

To enable MQTT humidifiers in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  humidifier:
    - command_topic: "bedroom_humidifier/on/set"
      target_humidity_command_topic: "bedroom_humidifier/humidity/set"
```

<a id='new_format'></a>

{% details "Previous configuration format" %}

The configuration format of manual configured MQTT items has changed.
The old format that places configurations under the `light` platform key
should no longer be used and is deprecated.

The above example shows the new and modern way,
this is the previous/old example:

```yaml
humidifier:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "bedroom_humidifier/on/set"
    target_humidity_command_topic: "bedroom_humidifier/humidity/set"
```
