The Kostal Plenticore integration allows you to get data from [Kostal Plenticore](https://www.kostal-solar-electric.com/) solar inverters and integrate them into your Home Assistant installation. It allows you also to change some of settings values of the inverter.

The integration uses the REST-API interface which is also used by the integrated Web-UI and therefore uses the same password.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Sensors

The integration disables most of the sensors per default. You can enable it in the *Entity* page. The sensors are split into two sets, one for the process data and one for the setting values.

<div class='note'>
The Plenticore inverter provides much more data endpoints, some of them are also dependent of the version of the firmware. If you are missing process data values, open an issue with the necessary information or make an pull request.

<div class='note'>
The inverter does not provide any data about the energy that is fed into the grid directly, but the `pykoplenti` library provides it via virtual process data.
</div>

#### Configuration of the energy dashboard

The following sensors can be used in the [energy dashboard](/docs/energy/):

| Energy dashboard | Sensor |
|------------------|:-------|
| Grid consumption | Home Consumption from Grid Total |
| Solar production | Energy PV1 Total, Energy PV2 Total, Energy PV3 Total |
| Battery systems  | Battery Discharge Total, Battery Charge from PV Total |

<div class='note'>
Some of the energy is measured on the DC side and some on the AC side, so the values may differ slightly due to losses between DC and AC.
</div>

### Settings Sensors

The following sensors are available in the library:

| Name                    | Unit | RW | Description   |
|-------------------------|------|----|:--------------|
| Battery Dynamic SoC     |      | RW | Dynamic SoC. |
| Battery Smart Control   |      | RW | Enable smart battery control |
| Battery Strategy        |      | RW | Battery strategy. |
| Shadow Management       |      | RW | PV string shadow management. |

<div class='note'>
Setting values change less often, therefore these sensors are only polled every 5 minutes.
</div>

#### Battery Strategy

This sensor is on by default, which maps to the "Automatically" mode in the Kostal Plenticore Plus documentation. This mode is recommended for regions with little snowfall.

Turning this sensor off maps to the "Automatically economical" mode. Consequently, the inverter controls the battery charging automatically but switches the battery off when there is insufficient PV energy to charge the battery for longer periods. This mode is recommended for regions with a lot of snowfall.

#### Battery Smart Control

The Battery Smart Control sensor appears as a select field labeled "Battery Charging / Usage Mode" with three options:

- **None**: the battery is loaded immediately when there is PV energy spare.
- **Battery:SmartBatteryControl:Enable**: the battery loading optimizes grid feed-in and battery loading. This setting is recommended when the grid feed-in is limited to, for example, 70% of the Plenticore Plus peak power.
- **Battery:TimeControl:Enable**: battery charging/discharging can be configured flexibly at different times (tariff periods). Detailed settings must be done on the web frontend of the Kostal Plenticore Plus inverter. This option activates the time-controlled battery usage mode.

## Number

The following Number entities are available. The values could also be change from Home Assistant.

| Name                    | Unit | RW | Description   |
|-------------------------|------|----|:--------------|
| Battery min Home Consumption | W    | RW | Min. home consumption power for battery. |
| Battery min SoC         | %    | RW | Min. SoC of battery. |
