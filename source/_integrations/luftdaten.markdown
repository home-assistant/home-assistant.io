The Sensor.Communtiy integration will query the open data API of [Sensor.Community](https://sensor.community) to monitor air quality and other weather data from a specific (self build) sensor station.

## Prerequisites

To get the ID of a particle, pressure, noise, temperature, or humidity sensor by selecting it on the [Sensor.Community map](https://maps.sensor.community/).
After selecting the sensor, it will show the needed ID in the sidebar with a `#` in front of it.
