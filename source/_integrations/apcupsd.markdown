[apcupsd](http://www.apcupsd.org/) status information can be integrated into Home Assistant when the Network Information Server (NIS) [is configured](http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#nis-server-client-configuration-using-the-net-driver) on the APC device.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Sensor](#sensors)

## Home Assistant add-on installation

Install this [unofficial add-on](https://github.com/korylprince/hassio-apcupsd/) to use this integration with Home Assistant. Keep in mind that we can't give you support for this add-on.

After installation, follow the instructions on the GitHub page to configure the plugin. Then continue to follow the integration configurations below.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% note %}

If you get `ConnectionRefusedError: Connection refused` errors in the Home Assistant logs, ensure the [apcupsd](http://www.apcupsd.org/) configuration directives used by its Network Information Server is set to permit connections from all addresses [NISIP 0.0.0.0](http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#configuration-directives-used-by-the-network-information-server), else non-local addresses will not connect.

{% endnote %}


## Binary sensor

This integration provides a binary sensor for the following information from apcupsd:

- UPS status

## Sensors

This integration provides sensors for the following information from apcupsd based on their availability. Each sensor is listed here along with their corresponding resource name obtained from `apcaccess`. 

{% note %}

Some sensors are disabled by default, since they provide information that is only useful for advanced users. You can manually enable them in **{% my entities title="Settings -> Devices & Services -> Entities" %}** -> the sensor entity you want to enable -> Advanced settings -> Enabled.
