The `swisscom` {% term integration %} offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to an [Internet-Box](https://www.swisscom.ch/en/residential/help/device/internet-router.html) router from [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch) which is an Internet provider in Switzerland.

<div class='note'>
There are three models of Internet-Box (light, standard and plus). The platform has only been tested on the Internet-Box plus but the others should work as well because they have the same web interface.
</div>

To use an Internet-Box router in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: swisscom
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: false
  default: 192.168.1.1
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.
