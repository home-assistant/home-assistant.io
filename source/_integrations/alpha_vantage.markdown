The `alpha_vantage` sensor platform uses [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co) to monitor the stock market. This platform also provides detail about exchange rates.

To enable the `alpha_vantage` platform, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: alpha_vantage
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    symbols:
      - symbol: GOOGL
        name: Google
    foreign_exchange:
      - name: USD_EUR
        from: USD
        to: EUR
```

Either a symbol or a foreign exchange must be configured, otherwise you will not get any data.

## API information

Alpha Vantage offers two tiers of the API key, one free and one paid for. If you are using the free version, you will be limited to twenty-five queries per day. The sensor polls every 5 minutes, so you will only get data for the first two hours per day. This can be configured using the `scan_interval` variable.

The paid version starts at 75 queries per minute, increasing ticker quantity quite a bit.

## Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.
