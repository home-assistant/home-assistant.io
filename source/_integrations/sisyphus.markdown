The [Sisyphus](https://sisyphus-industries.com/) integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control your Sisyphus Kinetic Art Table.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Light** - Can be used to sleep/wake the table or adjust the brightness of the table light.
- **Media player** - Can be used to sleep/wake the table, play/pause, move between tracks, or toggle shuffle on and off. The "volume" control adjusts the table's speed.

The light and media players will be automatically added for each of your Sisyphus tables, if the Sisyphus integration is configured.

There are two ways to configure this integration. For the automatic discovery of your table(s), add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}:

```yaml
# This will auto-detect all Sisyphus tables on your local network.
sisyphus:
```

Auto-detection can be a little slow, so if your table has a fixed IP address or hostname, you may add a list of tables in your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}. For example:

```yaml
# This will skip auto-detection and add only the listed tables
sisyphus:
  - name: 'TABLE_NAME'
    host: "TABLE_IP_OR_HOSTNAME"
  - name: 'ANOTHER_TABLE_NAME'
    host: "ANOTHER_TABLE_IP_OR_HOSTNAME"
```

{% configuration %}

  type: string
