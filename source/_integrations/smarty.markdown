The `smarty` integration lets you control Salda [Smarty](http://www.salda.lt/en/products/category/compact-counter-flow-units) ventilation units from Home Assistant. You need a [MB-GATEWAY](http://www.salda.lt/en/products/item/5637227077) or something similar to connect to your local network.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Fan
- Sensor

The integration has a fan platform to view and control the ventilation speed, and a sensors platform to read:

- Outdoor air temperature
- Extract air temperature
- Supply air temperature
- Extract fan speed rpm
- Supply fan speed rpm
- Alarm
- Warning
- Filter Change Timer
