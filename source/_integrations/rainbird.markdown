This `rainbird` integration allows interacting with [LNK WiFi](https://www.rainbird.com/products/lnk-wifi-module) module of the Rain Bird Irrigation system in Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Calendar](#calendar)
- [Number](#number)
- [Switch](#switch)

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Configuration options

The integration has a configuration option to change the default amount of time that the irrigation
will run when turning on a zone switch (default is 6 minutes). This can be overridden with a service call (see below).

## Binary sensor

The `rainsensor` sensor will tell if you if the device has detected rain.

## Calendar

Some Rain Bird devices support automatic irrigation schedules configured with the Rain Bird app.
and are available in Home Assistant as a [Calendar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/calendar/) entity. You can view the program schedule in the UI, or trigger other automations
based on the irrigation start or end time.

## Number

The Rain Delay Number Entity lets you set and view  the number of days, if any, the automatic irrigation schedule has been delayed.

## Switch

Switches are automatically added for all available zones of configured controllers.

## Services

The integration exposes services to give additional control over a Rain Bird device.

### `rainbird.start_irrigation`

Start a Rain Bird zone for a set number of minutes. This service accepts a Rain Bird sprinkler
zone switch entity and allows a custom duration unlike the switch.
