 ## Shopping cart

This integration provides a list containing the content of your shopping cart. This list is provided as a [to-do list](/integrations/todo/) and can also be found in the to-do list dashboard in the main sidebar of your Home Assistant instance. 

You can add products to your shopping cart by entering a name in the **Add item** field. Just like with the [`picnic.add_product`](#service-picnicadd_product) service, a search will be done and the first item found will be added.

## Services

### Service `picnic.add_product`

Add a product to your cart using the `picnic.add_product` service, either using a product ID or a product name.
A search will be done and the first result will be added to the cart when one adds a product using a product name.
The service call will fail when no product can be found, or when no `product_id` or `product_name` is specified.

| `product_name`         | yes      | A product name to search for, the first search result will be added to the cart. |
| `amount`               | yes      | The amount to add, defaults to 1.                                                |
