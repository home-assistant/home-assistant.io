Traccar uses GPS for tracking and has support for over 1500 different types of devices. You can use the Traccar Server integration to communicate with your own [Traccar Server](https://www.traccar.org/server/), which is also available as [Home Assistant add-on](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=a0d7b954_traccar).

{% tip %}
Looking for documentation on how to setup the Traccar Client with webhooks in Home Assistant? See the [Traccar Client](/integrations/traccar/) integration documentation.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Events

The Traccar Server integration options allow you to define a list of events you want to listen for. These events will be sent to Home Assistant as [events](/docs/configuration/events/).

All events will be prefixed with `traccar_` followed by a snake_cased version of the event name.
Examples:

- The `deviceMoving` will be fired in Home Assistant as `traccar_device_moving`.
- The `geofenceExit` will be fired in Home Assistant as `traccar_geofence_exit`.
- The `alarm` will be fired in Home Assistant as `traccar_alarm`.

All events will also have the following data:

{% configuration_basic %}

Device ID:
  description: (`device_traccar_id`) This will be the device ID that the event is related to.
Device name:
  description: (`device_name`) This will be the name of the device that the event is related to.
Type:
  description: (`type`) This will be the type of the event.
Server time:
  description: (`serverTime`) This will be the time the event was received by the Traccar Server.
Attributes:
  description: (`attributes`) This will be a dictionary of attributes related to the event.

{% endconfiguration_basic %}

{% details "Example" %}

```json
{
    "device_traccar_id": 24,
    "device_name": "My Device",
    "type": "alarm",
    "serverTime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "attributes": {
      "custom_attribute": "value"
    },
}
```

{% enddetails %}

## Devices

The Traccar Server integration will create devices for each device registered in the Traccar Server with at least one position update.

These device representations in Home Assistant will have [entities](#entities) associated with them, which you can use in [automations](/docs/automation), [scripts](/docs/script), and display on your [dashboard](/docs/dashboard).

## Entities

The traccar server integration will create entities in with the following domains:

- [Binary Sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor)
- [Device Tracker](/integrations/device_tracker)
- [Sensor](/integrations/sensor)

For more details about each of these, see the sections below.

## Examples

So you set up the integration and it pulled in all your devices. Now what? Below are some examples of what you can do with the data provided by Traccar Server integration.

### Automations

In this section you will find some example automations that you can use to get started with the Traccar Server integration.

#### Do something when a device enters a geofence

The allows you to do something when the device "Millennium Falcon" enters the defined geofence.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://www.home-assistant.io/blueprints/integrations/traccar_server_device_enter_geofence.yaml" %}

{% details "Show me the YAML!" %}

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.millennium_falcon_geofence
    to: 'Tatooine'
action:
  ...
```

{% enddetails %}

#### Do something when a device are speeding

The allows you to do something when the device "Millennium Falcon" exceeds a defined speed.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://www.home-assistant.io/blueprints/integrations/traccar_server_device_speed_limit.yaml" %}

{% details "Show me the YAML!" %}

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.millennium_falcon_speed
    above: 1337
action:
  ...
```

If you want to include the speed in a notification, you can use the `{{ trigger.to_state.state }}` template.

Partial example:

```yaml
trigger:
  ...
action:
  - action: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "The current speed of the Millennium falcon is {{ trigger.to_state.state }}!"
```

{% enddetails %}
