The **Change device type of a switch** helper integrations lets you convert any Home Assistant switch into
a Home Assistant Light, Cover, Fan, Lock, Siren, or Valve.

In Home Assistant's world, a wall plug is a switch. And while that is correct
for a wall plug in general, those plugs are often used with e.g, a light
fixture or a fan. General-purpose relays are similar, as they are sometimes used for
things like locks or garage doors.

Using the **Change device type of a switch** helper integration, you can convert those switches into the
entity types that best matches your use case.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md name="Switch as X" %}
{% configuration_basic %}
Switch entity:
  description: The switch entity you want to convert into something else.
Type:
  description: The type of entity you want the switch to become.
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## **Change device type of a switch** from the existing entity

Where compatible, **Change device type of a switch** will appear on entity properties. A list of entities can be found in **{% my entities title="Settings > Devices & services > Entities" %}**.
