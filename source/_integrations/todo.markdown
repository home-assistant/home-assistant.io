The **To-do list** {% term integration %} provides to-do list {% term entities %}, allowing other integrations
to integrate to-do lists into Home Assistant. To-do lists are shown on the **To-do lists**
dashboard for tracking items and whether or not they have been completed.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

For example, [Local to-do](/integrations/local_todo/) is a fully local integration to create to-do lists and tasks within your Home Assistant instance, [Shopping list](/integrations/shopping_list) specifically for shopping that can be added to with Assist, or other integrations work with online services providing to-do list data.

## Viewing and managing to-do lists

Each to-do list is represented as its own entity in Home Assistant and can be
viewed and managed on a to-do list dashboard. You can find the to-do list dashboard
in the main sidebar of your Home Assistant instance.

## The state of a to-do list entity

The state of a to-do list entity is a number, which represents the number of
incomplete items in the list.

In addition, the entity can have the following states:

- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.

## Blueprint to add an item to a dedicated list

This blueprint allows you to create a script to add an
item to a pre-configured to-do list.

## Actions

Some to-do list integrations allow Home Assistant to manage the to-do items in the list. The
actions provided by some to-do list entities are described below or you can read more about [actions](/docs/scripts/perform-actions/).

### Action `todo.get_items`

Get to-do items from a to-do list. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [target selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector). The `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                               | Example                     |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `status`       | yes      | Only return to-do items with this status. | `needs_action`, `completed` |

This is a full example that returns all to-do items that have not been completed:

```yaml
action: todo.get_items
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  status:
    - needs_action
```

### Action `todo.add_item`

Add a new to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector) and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                      | Example                                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `item`         | no       | the name of the to-do Item.                                      | Submit income tax return                                     |
| `due_date`     | yes      | The date the to-do item is expected to be completed.             | 2024-04-10                                                   |
| `due_datetime` | yes      | The date and time the to-do item is expected to be completed.    | 2024-04-10 23:00:00                                          |
| `description`  | yes      | A more complete description than the one provided by the summary | Collect all necessary documents and submit the final return. |

Only one of `due_date` or `due_datetime` may be specified.

This is a full example in YAML:

```yaml
action: todo.add_item
target:
  entity_id: todo.personal_tasks
data:
  item: "Submit Income Tax Return"
  due_date: "2024-04-10"
  description: "Collect all necessary documents and submit the final return."
```

### Action `todo.update_item`

Update a to-do item. A to-do list `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector) and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                       | Example                                                      |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `item`         | no       | The name of the to-do Item to update.                             | Submit income tax return                                     |
| `rename`       | yes      | The new name of the to-do Item.                                   | Something else                                               |
| `status`       | yes      | The overall status of the To-do Item.                             | `needs_action` or `completed`                                |
| `due_date`     | yes      | The date the to-do item is expected to be completed.              | 2024-04-10                                                   |
| `due_datetime` | yes      | The date and time the to-do item is expected to be completed.     | 2024-04-10 23:00:00                                          |

```yaml
action: todo.update_item
