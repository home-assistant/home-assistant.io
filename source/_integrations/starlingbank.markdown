The Starling Bank sensor {% term integration %} allows you to monitor your account balance data as sensors in Home Assistant.

- Turn off the lights when money's tight?
- Play a song when you reach a savings goal?
- Sound an alarm if you go into your overdraft?

You can find more information about Starling Bank at [their website](https://www.starlingbank.com/). Information on their API can be found on their [developers site](https://developer.starlingbank.com/).

## Access token

Once you have your own Starling bank account you will need to sign up for a Starling developer account [here](https://developer.starlingbank.com/signup). You won't need to do any development but you will need to get a "Personal Access Token" that will allow the integration to access your account balance.

<div class='note info'>
  You control what access is granted using this token. This integration only needs very basic access (see below).
</div>

Once you've signed up:

1. Head to the [Personal Access Section](https://developer.starlingbank.com/personal/token) of your developer account.
2. Click "Create Token".
3. Give your token a name e.g., "Home Assistant".
4. Tick the permissions "account:read" and "balance:read". The others you can leave un-ticked.
5. Click "Create" and make a note of the newly created token, you will need this for your Home Assistant configuration.
