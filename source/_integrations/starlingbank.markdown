The Starling Bank sensor {% term integration %} allows you to monitor your account balance data as sensors in Home Assistant.

- Turn off the lights when money's tight?
- Play a song when you reach a savings goal?
- Sound an alarm if you go into your overdraft?

You can find more information about Starling Bank at [their website](https://www.starlingbank.com/). Information on their API can be found on their [developers site](https://developer.starlingbank.com/).

## Access token

Once you have your own Starling bank account you will need to sign up for a Starling developer account [here](https://developer.starlingbank.com/signup). You won't need to do any development but you will need to get a "Personal Access Token" that will allow the integration to access your account balance.

{% note %}
You control what access is granted using this token. This integration only needs very basic access (see below).
{% endnote %}

Once you've signed up:

1. Connect your personal Starling Bank account to your developer account. Head to [Personal Access Page](https://developer.starlingbank.com/personal) of your developer account.
2. Follow the instructions to generate the QR code to scan within the Starling mobile app to authorize and link your bank account to the developer account.
3. Head to the [Personal Access Section](https://developer.starlingbank.com/personal/token) of your developer account.
4. Click "Create Token".
5. Give your token a name, e.g., "Home Assistant".
6. Tick the permissions "account:read" and "balance:read". The others you can leave un-ticked.
7. Click "Create" and make a note of the newly created token, you will need this for your Home Assistant configuration.
