The `nmbs` {% term integration %} will create sensors for monitoring travel time and information between 2 stations.

## Configuration

To enable this {% term integration %}, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: nmbs
    station_from: "STATION_1"
    station_to: "STATION_2"
    station_live: "STATION_1"
    exclude_vias: true
```

The stations can only be provided by their standard names and not ids. The list of stations can be checked on the NMBS/SNCB website but for most accurate results check them on the [iRail API page](https://api.irail.be/stations/) which this integration uses internally.
