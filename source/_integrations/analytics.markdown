Home Assistant allows users to share their usage data via the analytics integration. The aggregated data is available at <https://analytics.home-assistant.io>. It is used to influence Home Assistant development priorities and to convince manufacturers to add local control and privacy-focused features.

## Data collection

The information sent depends on what options you opt-in to. You can opt-in during onboarding and by going to **{% my analytics title="Settings > System > Analytics" %}** .

{% my analytics badge %}

When enabled, data will be sent 15 minutes after each start, and every 24h after startup. Sent data is printed to your log.

### Basic analytics

This includes:

- Unique identifier for your system (to ensure each installation is counted once)
- Home Assistant version
- Home Assistant installation type
- Your country-code (derived server-side from your IP-address), example: `"NO"` for Norway.
  - If you live in the US this will also include the region (state) code, example: `"CO"` will be used if you live in Colorado.

If your system includes the Supervisor, this will also contain:

- If your installation is supported
- If your installation is healthy
- The architecture of your installation

If you are running Home Assistant Operating System, this will also contain:

- The board type you are using
- The version of the Operating System

{% details Example payload %}

```json
{
  "uuid": "12a3456bc78d90123ef4567g789012h3",
  "version": "{{current_version}}",
  "installation_type": "Home Assistant OS",
  "supervisor": {
    "healthy": true,
    "supported": true,
    "arch": "amd64"
  },
  "operating_system": {
    "board": "odroid-n2",
    "version": "{{site.data.version_data.hassos['odroid-n2']}}"
  }
}
```

{% enddetails %}

### Usage analytics

_Requires basic analytics to be enabled._

This includes:

- The names of all your core integrations
- The names and versions of all your custom integrations if you have any
- The name and version of the engine used in the [recorder integration](/integrations/recorder)
- Boolean to indicate that the [energy integration](/integrations/energy) is configured
- Boolean to indicate that [HTTP certificate](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#ssl_certificate) is configured

If your system includes the Supervisor, this will also contain:

- For each add-on
  - Name
  - Version
  - If protection mode is enabled
  - If auto update is enabled

{% details Example payload %}

```json
{
  "uuid": "12a3456bc78d90123ef4567g789012h3",
  "version": "{{current_version}}",
  "installation_type": "Home Assistant OS",
  "supervisor": {
    "healthy": true,
    "supported": true,
    "arch": "amd64"
  },
  "operating_system": {
    "board": "odroid-n2",
    "version": "{{site.data.version_data.hassos['odroid-n2']}}"
  },
  "integrations": ["awesome_integration"],
  "addons": [
      {
          "slug": "awesome_addon",
          "protected": true,
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "auto_update": false
      }
  ],
  "energy": {
    "configured": true
  },
  "recorder": {
    "engine": "sqlite",
    "version": "123"
  },
  "certificate": false
}
```

{% enddetails %}

### Statistics

_Requires basic analytics to be enabled._

This includes:

- Number of integrations
- Number of users
- Number of entities
- Number of automations

If your system includes the Supervisor, this will also contain:

- Number of installed add-ons

{% details Example payload %}

```json
{
  "uuid": "12a3456bc78d90123ef4567g789012h3",
  "version": "{{current_version}}",
  "installation_type": "Home Assistant OS",
  "supervisor": {
    "healthy": true,
    "supported": true,
    "arch": "amd64"
  },
  "operating_system": {
    "board": "odroid-n2",
    "version": "{{site.data.version_data.hassos['odroid-n2']}}"
  },
  "state_count": 1,
  "automation_count": 2,
  "integration_count": 3,
  "addon_count": 4,
  "user_count": 5
}
```

{% enddetails %}

### Diagnostics

If enabled, a crash report will be collected when an unexpected error occurs and uploaded to [Sentry](https://sentry.io). These reports will help fix bugs and improve performance and stability.

Crash reports are only visible to the Home Assistant Core developers. This feature is currently limited to the [Supervisor](/docs/glossary/#home-assistant-supervisor) and [OS-Agent](https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent).

## Data storage & processing

All data is received and processed by the Home Assistant Analytics Receiver ([source](https://github.com/home-assistant/analytics.home-assistant.io)).

When your installation sends a payload, that payload includes a unique identifier. This identifier is used to make sure that your installation is only counted once.

Your data is securely stored in [Cloudflare's Key-Value store](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/). It will be stored for a maximum of 60 days since the last update. Only aggregated data is made publicly available.

This is an example of how the information is stored:
{% configuration_basic %}
"uuid:12a3456bc78d90123ef4567g789012h3":
  description: "{'version': '{{current_version}}', 'installation_type': 'Home Assistant OS', 'country': 'NO'}"

{% endconfiguration_basic %}
