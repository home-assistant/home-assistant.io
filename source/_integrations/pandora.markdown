If you have a Pandora account, you can control it from Home Assistant with this media player.

<div class='note'>
This integration is only available on Home Assistant Core installation types. Unfortunately, it cannot be used with Home Assistant OS, Supervised or Container.

### Installation of Pianobar

This media player uses the [Pianobar command-line Pandora client](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar), which you have to install separately. This can be done on a Raspberry Pi 2/3 with Raspbian Jessie as follows . _(Note: Other platforms may have different installation processes)_

The version of pianobar that comes with Jessie has a bug, so you have to build a more recent version. The latest version depends on a recent version of libraries associated with FFmpeg, so you should make sure you go through the backport process documented in [The FFmpeg component](/integrations/ffmpeg/) before doing this. Install the following basic dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git libao-dev libgcrypt11-dev libfaad-dev libmad0-dev libjson-c-dev make pkg-config  libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

And now install the backported FFmpeg-related libraries (note that if you're using an older version of FFmpeg for other things on this machine, you may encounter issues after doings this):

```bash
sudo apt-get -t jessie-backports install libav-tools libavcodec-extra libavcodec-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev
```

Now clone the Pianobar repository and build pianobar:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git
cd pianobar
make clean && make
sudo make install
```

Configure Pianobar to auto-login and start playing a station (optional, see `man pianobar`) by creating and editing the `~/.config/pianobar/config` file:

```bash
password = Password
user = you@youraccount.com
```

Test it out by running `pianobar` in the command line. You should be able to listen to your Pandora stations.

### Configuration in Home Assistant

The Pandora player can be loaded by adding the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: pandora
```

That's it! Now you will find a media player. If you click it you will find all your stations listed as different sources. If you switch to one, the station will begin playing.
