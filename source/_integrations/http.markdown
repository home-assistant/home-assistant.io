The `http` integration serves all files and data required for the Home Assistant frontend. You only need to add this to your configuration file if you want to change any of the default settings.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

{% warning %}
The option `server_host` should only be used on a Home Assistant Core installation!

The [Set up encryption using Let's Encrypt](/blog/2015/12/13/setup-encryption-using-lets-encrypt/) blog post gives you details about the encryption of your traffic using free certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Reverse proxies

When using a reverse proxy, you will need to enable the `use_x_forwarded_for` and `trusted_proxies` options. Requests from reverse proxies will be blocked if these options are not set.
  
```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 10.0.0.200      # Add the IP address of the proxy server
    - 172.30.33.0/24  # You may also provide the subnet mask
```

## APIs

On top of the `http` integration is a [REST API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/), [Python API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api_lib_index/) and [WebSocket API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/websocket/) available.

The `http` platforms are not real platforms within the meaning of the terminology used around Home Assistant. Home Assistant's [REST API](/developers/rest_api/) sends and receives messages over HTTP.

## HTTP sensors

To use those kind of [sensors](#sensor) or [binary sensors](#binary-sensor) in your installation no configuration in Home Assistant is needed. All configuration is done on the devices themselves. This means that you must be able to edit the target URL or endpoint and the payload. The entity will be created after the first message has arrived.

If you want to use HTTP sensors, create a [Long-Lived Access Tokens](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token) in the Home Assistant UI in the **Security** section of your {% my profile title="**User profile**" %} page.

All [requests](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest#post-apistatesentity_id) need to be sent to the endpoint of the device and must be **POST**.

## IP filtering and banning

If you want to apply additional IP filtering, and automatically ban brute force attempts, set `ip_ban_enabled` to `true` and the maximum number of attempts. After the first ban, an `ip_bans.yaml` file will be created in the root configuration folder. It will have the banned IP address and time in UTC when it was added:

```yaml
127.0.0.1:
  banned_at: "2016-11-16T19:20:03"
```

After a ban is added a Persistent Notification is populated to the Home Assistant frontend.

## Hosting files

If you want to use Home Assistant to host or serve static files then create a directory called `www` under the configuration path (`/config`). The static files in `www/` can be accessed by the following URL `http://your.domain:8123/local/`, for example `audio.mp3` would be accessed as `http://your.domain:8123/local/audio.mp3`.

{% important %}
If you've had to create the `www/` folder for the first time, you'll need to restart Home Assistant.
{% endimportant %}

{% caution %}
Files served from the `www` folder (`/local/` URL), aren't protected by the Home Assistant authentication. Files stored in this folder, if the URL is known, can be accessed by anybody without authentication.
{% endcaution %}

## Binary sensor

The HTTP binary sensor is dynamically created with the first request that is made to its URL. You don't have to define it in the configuration first.

The sensor will then exist as long as Home Assistant is running. After a restart of Home Assistant the sensor will be gone until it is triggered again.

The URL for a binary sensor looks like the example below:

```bash
http://IP_ADDRESS:8123/api/states/binary_sensor.DEVICE_NAME
```

{% important %}
You should choose a unique device name (DEVICE_NAME) to avoid clashes with other devices.
{% endimportant %}

The JSON payload must contain the new state and can have a friendly name. The friendly name is used in the frontend to name the sensor.

```json
{"state": "on", "attributes": {"friendly_name": "Radio"}}
```

For a quick test `curl` can be useful to "simulate" a device.

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"state": "off", "attributes": {"friendly_name": "Radio"}}' \
    http://localhost:8123/api/states/binary_sensor.radio
```

To check if the sensor is working, use again `curl` to retrieve the [current state](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/).

```bash
$ curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       http://localhost:8123/api/states/binary_sensor.radio
{
    "attributes": {
        "friendly_name": "Radio"
    },
    "entity_id": "binary_sensor.radio",
    "last_changed": "16:45:51 05-02-2016",
    "last_updated": "16:45:51 05-02-2016",
    "state": "off"
}
```

To delete the sensor, send DELETE request with curl

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
       http://localhost:8123/api/states/binary_sensor.radio
```

### Examples

In this section you'll find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor, besides `curl`, which was shown earlier.

#### Using Python request module

As already shown on the [API](/developers/rest_api/) page, it's very simple to use Python and the [Requests](https://requests.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/) module for the interaction with Home Assistant.

```python
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8123/api/states/binary_sensor.radio",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "content-type": "application/json",
    },
    data=json.dumps({"state": "on", "attributes": {"friendly_name": "Radio"}}),
)
print(response.text)
```

#### Using `httpie`

[`httpie`](https://github.com/httpie/httpie) is a user-friendly CLI HTTP client.

```bash
$ http -v POST http://localhost:8123/api/states/binary_sensor.radio \
      'Authorization:Bearer LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN' content-type:application/json state=off \
      attributes:='{"friendly_name": "Radio"}'
```

## Sensor

The HTTP sensor is dynamically created with the first request that is made to its URL. You don't have to define it in the configuration first.

The sensor will then exist as long as Home Assistant is running. After a restart of Home Assistant the sensor will be gone until it is triggered again.

The URL for a sensor looks like the example below:

```bash
http://IP_ADDRESS:8123/api/states/sensor.DEVICE_NAME
```

{% important %}
You should choose a unique device name (DEVICE_NAME) to avoid clashes with other devices.
{% endimportant %}

 The JSON payload must contain the new state and should include the unit of measurement and a friendly name. The friendly name is used in the frontend to name the sensor.

```json
{"state": "20", "attributes": {"unit_of_measurement": "°C", "friendly_name": "Bathroom Temperature"}}
```

For a quick test, `curl` can be useful to "simulate" a device.

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"state": "20", "attributes": {"unit_of_measurement": "°C", "friendly_name": "Bathroom Temp"}}' \
       http://localhost:8123/api/states/sensor.bathroom_temperature
```

You can then use `curl` again to retrieve the [current sensor state](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/) and verify the sensor is working.

```bash
$ curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       http://localhost:8123/api/states/sensor.bathroom_temperature
{
    "attributes": {
        "friendly_name": "Bathroom Temp",
        "unit_of_measurement": "\u00b0C"
    },
    "entity_id": "sensor.bathroom_temperature",
    "last_changed": "09:46:17 06-02-2016",
    "last_updated": "09:48:46 06-02-2016",
    "state": "20"
}
```
