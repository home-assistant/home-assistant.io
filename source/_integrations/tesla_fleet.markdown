The Tesla Fleet API {% term integration %} exposes various sensors from Tesla vehicles and energy sites.

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Tesla](https://tesla.com) account and a Tesla vehicle, PowerWall, Solar, or Wall Connector.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Scopes

When connecting your Tesla account to Home Assistant, you **must** select the `Vehicle Information` or `Energy Product Information` scope. It is recommended you select all scopes for full functionality.

## Rate limits

Tesla restricts open-source integrations to the ["Discovery" plan](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/subscription-plans) which only allows for 200 vehicle data requests per day. The integration will initially poll every 90 seconds, making vehicle data requests only when the vehicle is awake, and then dynamically slow down polling based on how many vehicle data requests have been made in the last 24 hours.

## Entities

These are the entities available in the Tesla Fleet integration. Not all entities are enabled by default, and not all values are always available.

## Vehicle sleep

Constant API polling will prevent most Model S and Model X vehicles manufactured before 2021 from sleeping, so the integration will stop polling these vehicles for 15 minutes, after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can call the `homeassistant.update_entity` service to force polling the API, which will reset the timer.
