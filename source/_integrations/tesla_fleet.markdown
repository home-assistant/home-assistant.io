The Tesla Fleet API {% term integration %} exposes various sensors from Tesla vehicles and energy sites.

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Tesla](https://tesla.com) account and a Tesla vehicle, PowerWall, Solar, or Wall Connector, and must not have disabled the [My Home Assistant](/integrations/my/) integration.

{% details "Use a custom OAuth application" %}

The integration has a built-in OAuth application that will be suitable for most users. However, you can [create your own application](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api#step-2-create-an-application) for the Tesla Fleet API and configure it as an [application credential](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/application_credentials).
When creating the application, you must set the redirect URL to `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`, but the other URLs can be set as desired. You must also complete both [step 3](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api#step-3-generate-a-public-private-key-pair) and [step 4](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api#step-4-call-the-register-endpoint) before the application will be able to make API calls.

You will be prompted to pick your custom application credential when creating a Tesla Fleet config entry.

{% enddetails %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Scopes

When connecting your Tesla account to Home Assistant, you **must** select the `Vehicle Information` or `Energy Product Information` scope. It is recommended you select all scopes for full functionality.

## Rate limits

Tesla restricts open-source integrations to the ["Discovery" plan](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/subscription-plans) which only allows for 200 vehicle data requests per day. The integration will initially poll every 90 seconds, making vehicle data requests only when the vehicle is awake, and then dynamically slow down polling based on how many vehicle data requests have been made in the last 24 hours.

## Command signing

Certain vehicles, including all vehicles manufactured since late 2023, require vehicle commands to be encrypted end-to-end and signed with a private key. The Tesla Fleet integration is unable to perform this encryption at this time, so certain features may be disabled or throw an exception when used.

## Entities

These are the entities available in the Tesla Fleet integration. Not all entities are enabled by default, and not all values are always available.

## Vehicle sleep

Constant API polling will prevent most Model S and Model X vehicles manufactured before 2021 from sleeping, so the integration will stop polling these vehicles for 15 minutes, after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can call the `homeassistant.update_entity` service to force polling the API, which will reset the timer.

## Energy dashboard

The Tesla Fleet API only provides power data for Powerwall and Solar products. This means they cannot be used on the energy dashboard directly.

Energy flows can be calculated from `Battery power` and `Grid power` sensors using a [Template Sensor](/integrations/template/) to separate the positive and negative values into positive import and export values.
The `Load power`, `Solar power`, and the templated sensors can then use a [Riemann Sum](/integrations/integration/) to convert their instant power (kW) values into cumulative energy values (kWh),
which then can be used within the energy dashboard.
