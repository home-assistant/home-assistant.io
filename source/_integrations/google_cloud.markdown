The Google Cloud integration allows you to use [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) APIs and integrate them into Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Obtaining service account file

1. Visit [Cloud Resource Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager).
2. Click `CREATE PROJECT` button at the top.
3. Specify convenient `Project name` and click `CREATE` button.
4. [Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).
5. Enable needed Cloud API visiting one of the links below or [APIs library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library), selecting your `Project` from the dropdown list and clicking the `Continue` button:


    - [Text-to-speech](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=texttospeech.googleapis.com)
    - [Speech-to-text](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=speech.googleapis.com)
6. Set up authentication:

    1. Visit [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey)
    2. From the toolbar above the `Service account` list, select `Create service account`.
    3. In the `Service account name` field, enter any name.

    If you are requesting a text-to-speech API key:

    4. Don't select a value from the Role list. **No role is required to access this service**.
    5. Click `Create`. If a note appears, warning that this service account has no role, you may ignore that.

## Google Cloud text-to-speech

[Google Cloud text-to-speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/) converts text into human-like speech in [380+ voices across 50+ languages and variants](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices). It applies groundbreaking research in speech synthesis and Google's powerful neural networks to deliver high-fidelity audio. With this easy-to-use API, you can create lifelike interactions with your users that transform customer service, device interaction, and other applications.

### Pricing

The Cloud text-to-speech API is priced monthly based on the number of characters to synthesize into audio sent to the service. For up-to-date pricing, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/pricing).

### Text-to-speech configuration

Below settings can be configured in the options of the integration and in the `options` parameter of the `tts.speak` service.

{% configuration %}
language:
  description: "Default language of the voice, e.g.,  `en-US`. Supported languages, genders and voices listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices). Also there are extra not documented but supported languages (see dropdown [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/#streaming_demo_section))."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: en-US
gender:
  description: "Default gender of the voice, e.g.,  `male`. Supported languages, genders and voices listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices)."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: neutral
voice:
  description: "Default voice name, e.g.,  `en-US-Wavenet-F`. Supported languages, genders and voices listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices). **Important! This parameter will override `language` and `gender` parameters if set**."
  required: false
  type: string
encoding:
  description: "Default audio encoder. Supported encodings are `ogg_opus`, `mp3` and `linear16`."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: mp3
speed:
  description: "Default rate/speed of the voice, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and 0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed."
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 1.0
pitch:
  description: "Default pitch of the voice, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase of 20 semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease of 20 semitones from the original pitch."
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 0.0
gain:
  description: "Default volume gain (in dB) of the voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of 0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB) will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. Strongly recommend not to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for any value greater than that."
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 0.0
profiles:
  description: "An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are applied on (post synthesized) text-to-speech. Effects are applied on top of each other in the order they are given. Supported profile ids listed [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/audio-profiles)."
  required: false
  type: list
  default: "[]"
text_type:
  description: "Default text type. Supported text types are `text` and `ssml`. Read more on what is that and how to use SSML [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml)."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "text"
{% endconfiguration %}

```

## Google Cloud speech-to-text

[Google Cloud speech-to-text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) converts audio into text transcriptions for [125 languages and variants](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/speech-to-text-supported-languages).

### Pricing

Speech-to-text is priced based on the amount of audio successfully processed by the service each month, measured in increments of one second. For up-to-date pricing, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/pricing) under the Speech-to-text v1 API.

### Speech-to-text configuration

{% configuration %}
stt_model:
  description: "One of the transcription models [here](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/transcription-model). Defaults to `latest_short`."
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
