The `google_cloud` platform allows you to use [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) API and integrate them into Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To use Google Cloud Platform, you need to provide `config` directory relative path of [`API key`](#obtaining-an-api-key) file you are going to use. Place it under `config` folder and set `key_file` parameter in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
tts:
  - platform: google_cloud
    key_file: googlecloud.json
```

## Obtaining an API key

API key obtaining process described in corresponding documentation:

- [Text-to-speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-protocol)
- [Speech-to-text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/quickstart-protocol)
- [Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)

Basic instruction for all APIs:

1. Visit [Cloud Resource Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager).
2. Click `CREATE PROJECT` button at the top.
3. Specify convenient `Project name` and click `CREATE` button.
4. [Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).
5. Enable needed Cloud API visiting one of the links below or [APIs library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library), selecting your `Project` from the dropdown list and clicking the `Continue` button:


    - [Text-to-speech](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=texttospeech.googleapis.com)
    - [Speech-to-text](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=speech.googleapis.com)
    - [Geocoding](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=geocoding-backend.googleapis.com)
6. Set up authentication:

    1. Visit [this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey)
    2. From the toolbar above the `Service account` list, select `Create service account`.
    3. In the `Service account name` field, enter any name.

    If you are requesting a text-to-speech API key:

    4. Don't select a value from the Role list. **No role is required to access this service**.
    5. Click `Create`. If a note appears, warning that this service account has no role, you may ignore that.
    6. Return to the `Service account` list page and click on the service account you created in step 5 to see the details for this service account.
    7. Choose the `Keys` tab within the details view for this service account.
    8. In the `Add Key` dropdown, select `Create New Key`.
    9. Specify a `JSON` key type  and click `Create`.
    10. A `[serviceaccountname].json` file will download to your browser.


## Google Cloud text-to-speech

[Google Cloud text-to-speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/) converts text into human-like speech in more than 100 voices across 20+ languages and variants. It applies groundbreaking research in speech synthesis (WaveNet) and Google's powerful neural networks to deliver high-fidelity audio. With this easy-to-use API, you can create lifelike interactions with your users that transform customer service, device interaction, and other applications.

### Pricing

The Cloud text-to-speech API is priced monthly based on the amount of characters to synthesize into audio sent to the service.

| Voice                         | Monthly free tier         | Paid usage                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Neural2                       | 0 to 1 million bytes      | $16.00 USD / 1 million bytes      |
| Polyglot (Preview)            | 0 to 1 million bytes      | $16.00 USD / 1 million bytes      |
| Studio (Preview)              | 0 to 100 thousand bytes   | $160.00 USD / 1 million bytes     |
| Standard                      | 0 to 4 million characters | $4.00 USD / 1 million characters  |
| WaveNet                       | 0 to 1 million characters | $16.00 USD / 1 million characters |

  required: false
