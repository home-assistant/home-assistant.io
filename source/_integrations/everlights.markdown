[EverLights](https://myeverlights.com/) are permanent Christmas lights installed on a home's gutters or flashing. This integration can change all LEDs in a zone to a single color or activate a pattern that was previously saved to the control box.

### Configuration details

To enable EverLights, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: everlights
    hosts:
      - 192.168.1.123
      - 192.168.1.124
```

{% configuration %}
hosts:
  description: EverLights control box IP addresses.
  required: true
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

### Effects

EverLights patterns saved to the control box can be activated using the effect parameter to the `light.turn_on` service. If an effect is specified, then the color and brightness are ignored.

### Limitations

The EverLights control box status indicates if a zone is active but does not indicate the current color or pattern. The color and effect in the state attributes are based on the last execution of `light.turn_on`. If the control box scheduler or another app makes a change, then the state attributes are not updated.
