The **PrusaLink** {% term integration %} allows you to monitor your [Prusa 3D printer](https://www.prusa3d.com) and its progress with your Home Assistant installation. This integration works with Prusa MINI/MINI+, Prusa MK3.9/MK4, Prusa XL, and with the older Raspberry Pi-based Prusa MK2.5/MK3.

This integration has been updated to utilize the latest v1 API endpoints, which require firmware version 4.7.0 or later. If you own a Prusa MINI/MINI+, please make sure your printer is running firmware 5.1.0 or a more recent version. Firmware versions 4.7.x and 5.0.x are not available for this model. For Prusa MK2.5/MK3, this integration requires PrusaLink version 0.7.2 or later.

 - [Prusa MK3.9/MK4/XL](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-update-firmware-mk4-xl_453086)
 - [Prusa MK2.5/MK3](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/how-to-update-prusalink-mk2-5-s-mk3-s-_650837)

## Obtaining hostname, username, and password

### Prusa MINI/MINI+/MK3.9/MK4/XL

 - On your printer, navigate to **Settings** > **Network** > **PrusaLink**.
 - Find the device's **IP address**. Alternatively, you can look for the printer's IP address or hostname on your router.
 - Note that for some models, the username may not be visible, as it is hardcoded to `maker`.
 - Depending on your model, the password entry may not be called **Password**, but **API key**.

### Prusa MK2.5/MK3

 - The device's **IP address** is displayed on the printer LCD after PrusaLink starts up. Alternatively, you can look for the printer's IP address or hostname on your router.
 - Use the **username** and **password** you entered during the initial PrusaLink setup (not the API key).
