Integrates [Aranet](https://aranet.com/) devices into Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The Aranet integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional.

## Supported devices

- [Aranet2](https://aranet.com/products/aranet2/)
- [Aranet4](https://aranet.com/products/aranet4/)

  The Aranet integration requires that your Aranet device is updated to at least firmware version 1.2.0 and has the "Smart Home integration" feature enabled. Both of these can be done within the settings portion of the Aranet Home mobile application on both Android and iOS.
