The International Space Station (ISS) integration uses the
[Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/)
to let you know where the station is.

It will also tell you how many people are in space.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

<div class='note warning'>

If you enable "Show on map" in the options for this integration then the location attributes 
are named `latitude` and `longitude`. The default name of the location attributes is
`lat` and `long` to avoid showing them on the map.
