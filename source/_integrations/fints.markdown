With the FinTS sensor, you can fetch your account information from your bank. This only works with banks that support the FinTS (aka. HBCI) standard. The FinTS standard used by many German banks. So if you do not have a German bank account, this will most likely not work for you. To find out if your bank supports FinTS, check the bank's website or call their hotline.

## Configuration

To find out the configuration for your bank, check their website or call their hotline. Do not use random information you find on the Internet! As you're storing your bank account information in the Home Assistant configuration: Make sure that this configuration is not accessible to anyone.

For each account you have with the bank, a separate sensor is created. If you have several accounts with a bank, you can select which ones you want to have, and you can also give the accounts a name.
