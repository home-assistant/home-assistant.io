The `mqtt` image platform allows you to integrate the content of an image file sent through MQTT into Home Assistant as an image.
The `image` platform is a simplified version of the `camera` platform that only accepts images.
Every time a message under the `image_topic` in the configuration is received, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated. Messages received on `image_topic` should contain the full contents of an image file, for example, a JPEG image, without any additional encoding or metadata.

This can be used with an application or a service capable of sending images through MQTT.

An alternative setup is to use the `url_topic` option to receive an image URL for a new picture to show.

## Configuration

To enable this image in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - image:
      url_topic: mynas/status/url
```

### Example receiving images from a URL

Add the configuration below to your `configuration.yaml`.

To test it publish an image URL to the topic from the console:

```shell
mosquitto_pub -h <mqtt_broker> -t mynas/status/url -m "https://design.home-assistant.io/images/logo.png"
```

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - image:
      url_topic: mynas/status/url
```

{% endraw %}

### Example receiving images from a file

Add the configuration below to your `configuration.yaml`.

To test it, publish an image URL to the topic from the console:

```shell
mosquitto_pub -h <mqtt_broker> -t mynas/status/file -f <logo.png>
```

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - image:
      image_topic: mynas/status/file
      content_type: image/png
```

{% endraw %}
