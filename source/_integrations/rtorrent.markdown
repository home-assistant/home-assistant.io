The `rtorrent` platform allows you to monitor your downloads with [rTorrent](https://rakshasa.github.io/rtorrent/) from within Home Assistant and setup automations based on the information.

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: rtorrent
    url: "http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/RPC2"
    monitored_variables:
      - 'current_status'
      - 'download_speed'
      - 'upload_speed'
      - 'all_torrents'
      - 'stopped_torrents'
      - 'complete_torrents'
      - 'uploading_torrents'
      - 'downloading_torrents'
      - 'active_torrents'
```

This sensor requires the rTorrent XML-RPC API exposed on an HTTP interface.
Note that for security reasons, simply using the SCGI interface (default `localhost:5000`) of rTorrent won't work.
The [official reference](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/RPC-Setup-XMLRPC) describes how to set up that HTTP interface.

Alternatively, the [arch-rtorrentvpn](https://github.com/binhex/arch-rtorrentvpn) container can be used with `url` set to `http://admin:rutorrent@127.0.0.1:9080/RPC2`.
