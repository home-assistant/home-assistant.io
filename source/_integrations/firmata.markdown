[Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) can be used to add analog and digital inputs and outputs to Home Assistant. This allows for buttons, switches, motion detectors, relay control, sensors, potentiometers, dimmers, etc. The component can currently connect to a Firmata board via serial or serial over USB.

The Firmata protocol is a standard protocol for microcontrollers. Most of these boards support digital and analog inputs and outputs. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and Arduino-compatible microcontroller development boards are the most popular boards to use with Firmata.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary Sensor](#binary_sensor)
- [Light](#lights)
- [Sensor](#sensors)
- [Switch](#switches)

## Configuration

You will need to upload a [Firmata firmware](https://github.com/firmata/) to your board. Please upload any `StandardFirmata` sketch to your board; please refer to the [Arduino documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Howto) for further information for uploading sketches. Firmata is available in the Arduino Library Manager in the Arduino IDE. You may also use a [Firmata Express](https://github.com/MrYsLab/FirmataExpress).

To integrate Arduino boards with Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

<div class='note warning'>
Firmata does not store the last state across power cycles. This means that with every powerup the pins are set to off/low and after every initialization, they will be set to the default that you have configured in YAML.
</div>

<div class='note warning'>

Firmata may cycle pins HIGH/LOW during initialization. If your pins should not be accidentally cycled, you may need to modify your Firmtata sketch or if you are using a relay board use an output pin as VCC. See this issue for details: [Make initial pin value configurable](https://github.com/firmata/arduino/issues/166).

</div>

You may configure multiple Firmata boards. Each board has the following options:

{% configuration %}
serial_port:
  description: The port where your board is connected to your Home Assistant host. It is recommended to use the `by-id` reference (instead of numerical like `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`) since these will never change after a reboot. If you are using HassOS, you can find a list of connected serial devices in the Hardware dialog on the System tab of the Supervisor.
  required: true
  type: string
serial_baud_rate:
  description: The baud rate of the Arduino sketch. If you are using Firmata Express, then you do not need to set this option. **If you are using the default StandardFirmata, then you should set this to `57600`.**
  required: false
  type: integer
arduino_instance_id:
  description: If you are using Firmata Express, then this should match the instance number that you set in the sketch.
  required: false
  type: integer
arduino_wait:
  description: Time in seconds to wait for the Arduino is initially respond. May need to be used for boards that respond slowly at first connection.
  required: false
  type: integer
sleep_tune:
  description: Time in seconds to wait for reply from the Arduino after sending a command. Rarely needs to be adjusted.
  required: false
  type: float
sampling_interval:
  description: Sampling interval in millseconds sent to Firmata. Most Firmata sketches will ignore any interval less than 10 milliseconds.

      type: string
    initial:
      description: The initial output of the pin after initialization. This should be a Home Assistant-like value from 0 to 255; this value is then plugged into the `minimum`/`maximum` scaling (if configured).
      required: false
      default: 0
      type: integer
    minimum:
      description: The minimum PWM/analog value to send (inclusive). This is the lowest allowed value that the pin will output. The Home Assistant brightness value (0 to 255) will be scaled with this value as the lower value of the range.
      required: false
      default: 0
      type: integer
    maximum:
      description: The maximum PWM/analog value to send (inclusive). This is the highest allowed value that the pin will output. The Home Assistant brightness value (0 to 255) will be scaled with this value as the higher value of the range.

      required: false
      default: 40

{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>
If you double-configure a pin, the integration will fail to configure the second one that it attempts to set up and will log an error.
</div>

<div class='note'>

To invert/negate a light, set the `maximum` to `0` and the `minimum` to `255`.
