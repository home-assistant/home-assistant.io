This platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a [BT Smart Hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Smart_Hub) based router.
This router is sometimes referred to as the BT Home Hub 6.

## Configuration

To use a BT Smart Hub router in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: bt_smarthub
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your router
  default: 192.168.1.254
  required: false
  type: string
smarthub_model:
  description: The model of your BT Smarthub 1 or 2. If this option is omitted, it will attempt to detect the hub model.
  required: false
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions on how to configure the people to be tracked.
