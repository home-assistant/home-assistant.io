The **Vodafone Station** {% term integration %} allows you to control your [Vodafone Station](https://www.vodafone.it/privati/area-supporto/assistenza-dispositivi/vodafone-station.html) based router.

{% note %}
The integration supports only Sercomm models so far.
{% endnote %}

There is support for the following platform types within Home Assistant:

- **Device tracker** - presence detection by looking at connected devices.
- **Sensor** - external IP address, uptime, firmware, resources and network monitors.
- **Button** - restart router, dsl/fiber/internet key connections.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Integration options

It is possible to change some behaviors through the {% term integration %} options.
To change the settings, go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %}. On the **Vodafone Station** integration, select the cogwheel. Then select **Configure**.

- **Consider home**: Number of seconds that must elapse before considering a disconnected device "not at home".

## Additional info

### Device tracker

**Note**: If you don't want to automatically track newly detected devices, disable the {% term integration %} system option `Enable new added entities`.

### Tested models

This {% term integration %} was tested against the following models from Sercomm:

- Vodafone Power Station (SHG3000)
- Vodafone WiFi 6 Station (RHG3006)
- Vodafone Gigabox (SHG3000) - supplied by [Vodafone Ireland](https://deviceguides.vodafone.ie/vodafone/gigabox-windows-10/)
