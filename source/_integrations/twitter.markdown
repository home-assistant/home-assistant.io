The `twitter` notification platform uses [X](https://twitter.com) to deliver notifications from Home Assistant.

## Setup

Make sure you have a developer account registered with X, then go to [X Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and create an application. If you don't have a developer account you need to apply for one, it can take some time to get approved.

### App permissions

If you do not perform this step, your application will only receive read permissions and will not be able to post tweets on behalf of your account on X.

1. Visit **Settings** of the application.
2. Select `Set up` under **User authentication settings**.
3. Check the box for `OAuth 1.0a`.
4. Set the app permission to `Read and write`.
5. Enter a `callback` and `website` URL and click save.

It does not matter for the integration what you enter as a callback or website URL.

### Generate tokens and secrets

1. Visit **Keys and tokens** of the application.
2. Select `Regenerate` under **Consumer keys** to get your **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.
3. Select `Regenerate` under **Access Tokens and Secret** to get your **Access Token** and **Access Token Secret**.

## Configuration

To add X to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: twitter
    consumer_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    consumer_secret: YOUR_API_SECRET
    access_token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    access_token_secret: YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET
```
