This integration allows you to control a Z-Wave network via the [Z-Wave.Me Z-Way](https://z-wave.me/z-way/). It combines the performance and the power of the diagnostics tools built-in Z-Way with the flexibility of Home Assistant. The integration brings all Z-Way devices in Home Assistant (Z-Wave, EnOcean, HTTP based, and others).

URL:

  required: true
  type: string
API Token:

{% endconfiguration_basic %}

When connecting via find.z-wave.me remote access service you need to use a token with a global scope (log-in to Z-Way via [find.z-wave.me](https://find.z-wave.me) for this).

Example of connecting to Z-Way in the local network:
 - URL: 192.168.1.39:8083
 - API Token: /112f7a4a-0051-cc2b-3b61-1898181b9950

Example of connecting to Z-Way via remote access find.z-wave.me:
 - URL: wss://find.z-wave.me
 - API Token: 0481effe8a5c6f757b455babb678dc0e764feae279/112f7a4a-0051-cc2b-3b61-1898181b9950

 Example of connecting to Z-Way with a static public IP address:
 - URL: wss://87.250.250.242:8083
 - API Token: /112f7a4a-0051-cc2b-3b61-1898181b9950


<div class='note warning'>

  To grant access only to certain devices, create a new user and select the necessary devices from the list. Then use the API token of that user. It is suggested **not to use the API token of the admin**.

  You can use Z-Wave.Me UI with its enhanced Z-Wave network diagnostics tools together with the Home Assistant UI.

## Hardware requirements

Z-Wave.Me Z-Way requires Z-Wave.Me hardware:
 - [RaZberry 7](https://z-wave.me/products/razberry/) and [RaZberry 7 Pro](https://z-wave.me/products/razberry/)
 - [RaZberry](https://z-wave.me/products/razberry-old/)
 - [UZB1](https://z-wave.me/products/uzb/ )
 - [Hub1](https://z-wave.me/products/hub/)
 - or any other Z-Wave.Me based controller.

## Installing Z-Way

Z-Wave.Me Z-Way runs on various platforms: Raspberry Pi OS, Linux, Windows. Installation instructions are available here: https://z-wave.me/z-way/download-z-way/

## Migration to Z-Way

To migrate from any other Z-Wave controller to Z-Way, include Z-Way as a secondary controller (with security to let Z-Way learn the network key). Use the Z-Way migration tool to make the controller primary in your network.
