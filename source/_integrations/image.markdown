The **Image** {% term integration %} allows other integrations to display a static image.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

## Image states

The {% term state %} of an image entity is a timestamp showing the date and time when the image was last changed, for example, `2026-01-01T12:00:00.123456+00:00`. The Home Assistant interface shows it in your local date and time format.

In addition, the entity can have the following states. Each item shows the interface label, followed by the stored state:

- **Unavailable** (`unavailable`): The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown** (`unknown`): The state is not yet known.
