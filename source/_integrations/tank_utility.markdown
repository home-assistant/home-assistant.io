Add [Tank Utility](https://www.tankutility.com/) propane tank monitors to Home Assistant.

## Setup

### Authentication

Authentication for the Tank Utility API is performed with the same email and password credentials used at [https://app.tankutility.com](https://app.tankutility.com).

### Devices

Each item in the list of devices is a 24 character string. These values can be found by clicking on the **Usage Reports** link at the bottom of the graph on the [Tank Utility devices page](https://app.tankutility.com/#/devices).

The device item value is the last segment of the URL path, e.g., the URL
[https://app.tankutility.com/#/reports/000000000000000000000000](https://app.tankutility.com/#/reports/000000000000000000000000) would indicate `000000000000000000000000` as a device value.

### Using TankUtility API to Obtain Device ID

1. Obtain your personal token:

   ```bash
   curl --user <my_username>:<my_password> https://data.tankutility.com/api/getToken`
   ```

   The JSON response structure should resemble:
   
   ```json
   {"token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE0MzgyMjQwODE0NjIsInYiOjAsImQiOnsidWleejoic2ltcGxlbG9naW46MzM1In0sImlhdCI6wwDIyMzk5NX0.kbYzxRtbGB2ke3IBgQTVMNQprHOWJZFgQQnPK6Wyas4"}
   ```

2. Receive the list of devices you have in your account:

   ```bash
   curl https://data.tankutility.com/api/devices?token=<my_personal_token>
   ```

   The JSON response structure should resemble:

   ```json
   {"devices":["54df6a066667531535371367","54ff69057492666782350667"]}
   ```

## Configuration

To enable the component, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
