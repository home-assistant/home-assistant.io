The `august` integration allows you to integrate your [August](https://august.com/) and some Yale Access devices in Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Known issues with battery reporting

The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (Gen 4) uses different battery technology (lithium-ion) than the other locks. The battery charge value reported by the lock detail API has frequently been reported as incorrect for these models.
		
Other August locks expect to be powered by AA alkaline (non-rechargeable) batteries. Rechargeable batteries in these locks will result in incorrect reporting of battery charge.

## Push updates not available for some entities

While most entities can be updated via the push API, August/Yale does not offer a push API for some data, which means these entities will update slower:

- Doorbell ding sensor (Doorman models only)
- Lock Battery sensor
- Lock Operation sensor

## Binary sensor

If you have an August Doorbell, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see following sensors:

- Doorbell ding sensor
- Doorbell motion sensor
- Doorbell online sensor

If you have an August Smart Lock with DoorSense, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:

- Door sensor

## Button

Buttons are created to wake locks from a deep sleep. If your lock is not reporting a status, it may be in a deep sleep, and the button can be used to wake it. Locks are not automatically woken from deep sleep to preserve battery life.

## Camera

The `august` camera platform allows you to view the latest camera image (triggered by motion) by your [August](https://august.com/) device in Home Assistant.

## Sensor

If you have an August Doorbell with a battery, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:

- Doorbell Battery

If you have an August Smart Lock, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:

- Lock Battery
- Lock Operation

If you have an August Keypad, once you have enabled the August integration, you should see the following sensors:

- Keypad Battery

## Integration with Yale Access Bluetooth

Following Assa Abloy, Yale's parent company, purchasing August in 2017, most newer devices use the Yale Access branding. 

The [Yale Access Bluetooth](/integrations/yalexs_ble) integration provides local control over Bluetooth of many Yale Access locks and some August locks that use the same system. 

For locks that support the Yale Access system, the August integration can keep your offline access keys up to date to ensure you can operate your lock over Bluetooth. The following requirements must be met for the offline key updates to work:

- The August integration must support the lock.
- The [Yale Access Bluetooth integration](/integrations/yalexs_ble) must support the lock.
- The Bluetooth integration must be active and functional.
- The lock must be discoverable by the [Yale Access Bluetooth integration](/integrations/yalexs_ble).
- The account logged in with the August integration must have the offline keys.

### Troubleshooting offline keys updates

- If you do not know which account has the offline keys, configure August integration with each different Owner account until you find the one that holds the keys. You may need to make a new owner account and grant the account access to your lock to force the keys to synchronize with the cloud service.
- Ensure the lock is in range and discoverable by the [Yale Access Bluetooth integration](/integrations/yalexs_ble).

## Presence detection with lock operation

Using the lock operation sensors, you can detect when a user operates a lock and is physically present (not remote). The below automation example (added to `automations.yaml`) will trigger when the user named “John Doe” in August locks or unlocks the door from the keypad (if present), via Bluetooth from their phone, or by auto-unlock. The state of the sensor will be the name of the party operating the lock as returned by August.

{% raw %}

```yaml
- id: "1583706446906"
  alias: "joe_doe_front_door_operate"
  description: John Doe locks or unlocks the Front Door
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.front_door_operator
    platform: state
    to: John Doe
  condition:
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ not state_attr('sensor.front_door_operator', 'remote') }}"
  action:
  - data: {}
    entity_id: camera.inside
    service: camera.turn_off
```

{% endraw %}
