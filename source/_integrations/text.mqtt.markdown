The `mqtt` Text platform allows you to integrate devices that show text that can be set remotely. Optionally the text state can be monitored too using MQTT.

## Configuration

To enable MQTT text platform in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - text:
      command_topic: command-topic
```

{% configuration %}

## Examples

This is an example of a manual configured MQTT `text` item.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - text:
      name: "Remote LCD screen"
      icon: mdi:ab-testing
      mode: "text"
      command_topic: "txt/cmd"
      state_topic: "txt/state"
      min: 2
      max: 20
```

{% endraw %}
