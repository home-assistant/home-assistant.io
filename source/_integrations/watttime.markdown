The **WattTime** {% term integration %} allows users to get real-time emissions data for a latitude/longitude from [WattTime](https://www.watttime.org).

## Registering an account

WattTime account registration is accomplished [via the REST API itself](https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#register-new-user). The simplest way to do this is by using cURL on the command line:

```bash
curl -X "POST" "https://api2.watttime.org/v2/register" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "username": "<USERNAME>",
       "password": "<PASSWORD>",
       "email": "<EMAIL>",
       "org": "<ORG>"
     }'
```

Note that the `org` value can be anything you like â€“ it doesn't need to represent a real entity.

## Sensors

{% note %}
The sensors available to you will depend on the type of WattTime subscription you have. You can reach out to WattTime to upgrade your subscription via [their website](https://www.watttime.org/contact/).
