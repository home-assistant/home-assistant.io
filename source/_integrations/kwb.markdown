The `kwb` integration integrates the sensors of KWB Easyfire pellet central heating units with the Comfort3 controller (https://www.kwb.net/produkte/) into Home Assistant.

Direct connection via serial (RS485) or via telnet terminal server is supported. The serial cable has to be attached to the control unit port 25 (which is normally used for detached control terminals).

Since this serial protocol is proprietary and closed, only most temperature sensors and a few control relays are supported, the rest is still WIP (see <https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/274137>).

Direct connection via serial port:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
- platform: kwb
    name: kwb
    device: "/dev/ttyUSB0"
    type: serial
    raw: false
```

Telnet terminal server with a serial-ethernet converter:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
  - platform: kwb
    name: kwb
    host: <ip>
    port: 23
    type: tcp
    raw: false
```

Take a good look at which configuration variables are for `TCP` use or for `serial` use.

{% configuration %}
