This platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a [BT Home Hub 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Home_Hub) based router.

To use a BT Home Hub 5 router in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: bt_home_hub_5
    host: 192.168.1.254
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of your router.
  required: false
  default: 192.168.1.254
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.
