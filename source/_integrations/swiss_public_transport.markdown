The Swiss public transport integration will give you the next three departure times from a given location to another one in Switzerland.

The [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/) only allows 1000 requests per 24 hours. The default polling rate is set to `90s`, which is just enough for one connection polling continuously. If more entries are needed, consider [defining a custom polling interval](#defining-a-custom-polling-interval) to reduce the amount of requests.

The [Stationboard](https://transport.opendata.ch/examples/stationboard.html) website can help to determine the exact name of the start and the end station.
