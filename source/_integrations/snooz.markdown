Integrates [SNOOZ](https://getsnooz.com/) devices into Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The SNOOZ integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional.

## Supported devices

- [SNOOZ White Noise Machine](https://getsnooz.com/products/snooz-white-noise-machine)

## Setup

Once a device is discovered, it needs to be put into pairing mode to complete setup.

### Entering pairing mode

1. Ensure the device is not connected to a mobile app or any other Bluetooth controller.
2. Hold your finger on the power button until all buttons begin pulsing on and off (~ 5 seconds).

## Platforms

### Fan

Devices are exposed as Fan entities with a persistent connection to the device.

Fan speed percentage is mapped to the device volume level.

{% note %}
Speed percentages less than 10 have no effect - they all map to a value of 1 on the device.
{% endnote %}

## Services

### Service `snooz.transition_on`

Transition the volume level over the specified duration. If the device is powered off, the transition will start at the lowest volume level.

{% my developer_call_service badge service="snooz.transition_on" %}

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `duration` | yes | Number of seconds to transition to target volume.
| `volume` | yes | Percentage volume level. If not specified, the volume on the device is used.

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "04:20:00"
    action:
      - service: snooz.transition_on
        target:
          entity_id: fan.snooz_abcd
        data:
          volume: 33
          duration: 120
```

### Service `snooz.transition_off`

Transition the volume level to the lowest setting over the specified duration, then power off the device.

{% note %}
Once the transition completes, the volume level is restored to the value before the transition started.
{% endnote %}

{% my developer_call_service badge service="snooz.transition_off" %}

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `duration` | yes | Number of seconds to complete the transition.

#### Automation example

```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "16:20:00"
    action:
      - service: snooz.transition_off
        target:
          entity_id: fan.snooz_abcd
        data:
          duration: 120
```
