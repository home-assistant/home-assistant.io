The [Smart Meter Texas](https://www.smartmetertexas.com/) integration allows Texas residents to integrate their electric meters into Home Assistant. This integration will create a sensor for each meter that shows the current reading.

On its own this sensor is not particularly useful. However, combined with a [`utility_meter`](/integrations/utility_meter/) sensor you can obtain usage over a month, for example.

## Setup

Any Texas electricity consumer can register an account.

1. Go to [Smart Meter Texas](https://www.smartmetertexas.com/)
2. Select _Sign Up_
3. Choose _residential_ as your account type
4. You will need following details which can be found on your electric bill.
    - The name of your retail electric provider
    - Your meter number
    - Your ESIID (Electric Service Identifier)

<div class='note'>
Due to API limits, this sensor refreshes once per hour. The limit is 24 meter readings per calendar day.
