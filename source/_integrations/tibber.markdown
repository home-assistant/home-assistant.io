The `tibber` integration provides a sensor with the current electricity price if you are a [Tibber](https://tibber.com/) customer.
If you have a [Tibber Pulse](https://tibber.com/no/store/produkt/pulse) or [Watty](https://tibber.com/se/store/produkt/watty-smart-energimatare) it will also show the electricity consumption in real-time. You get a sensor for monthly consumption, monthly cost, and monthly peak hour. If you do have a real-time meter it is updated once every hour, otherwise it is updated once per day. Statistics with hourly consumption and cost data is generated that can be used in the [Energy Dashboard](/docs/energy/) (the ids are `tibber:energy_consumption_HOMEID` and `tibber:energy_totalcost_HOMEID`). If you produce energy there are also statistics with hourly production and profit data generated which can also be used there (the ids are `tibber:energy_production_HOMEID` and `tibber:energy_profit_HOMEID`).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Notifications](#notifications)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

## Setup

Go to [developer.tibber.com/settings/accesstoken](https://developer.tibber.com/settings/accesstoken) to get your API token.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Notifications

Tibber can send a notification by calling the [`notify.send_message` service](/integrations/notify/). It will send a notification to all devices registered in the Tibber account.

To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).

### Send message

```yaml
action:
  service: notify.send_message
  data:
    entity_id: notify.tibber
    title: Your title
    message: This is a message for you!
```

## Sensor

The `tibber` sensor provides the current electricity price if you are a [Tibber](https://tibber.com/) customer.
You also get sensors for monthly consumption, monthly cost, and monthly peak hour
If you have a Tibber Pulse it will also show the electricity consumption in real time.

## Available sensors

- Accumulated cost since midnight (requires active Tibber power deal)
- kWh consumed since midnight
- net kWh produced since midnight
- net kWh produced since last hour shift
- Current on L1, L2 and L3
- Estimate of kWh consumption current hour
- kWh consumed since since last hour shift
- Average consumption since midnight (Watt)
- Last meter active import register state (kWh)
- Last meter active export register state (kWh)
- Peak consumption since midnight (Watt)
- Min consumption since midnight (Watt)
- Consumption at the moment (Watt)
- Consumption at the moment (Watt)
- Net production (A-) at the moment (Watt)
- The total price (energy + taxes)
- Device signal strength (Pulse - dB; Watty - percent)
- Voltage on phase 1, 2 and 3
- Monthly cost
- Monthly net consumption
- Monthly peak hour
- Time of max hour consumption

## Examples

In this section, you will find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

### Electricity price

The electricity price can be used to make automations. The sensor has a `max_price` and `min_price` attribute, with max and min price for the current day. Here is an example to get a notification when the price is above 90% of the maximum price for the day:

{% raw %}

```yaml
- alias: "Electricity price"
  trigger:
    platform: time_pattern
  # Matches every hour at 1 minutes past whole
    minutes: 1
  condition:
    condition: template
    value_template: '{{ float(states('sensor.electricity_price_hamretunet_10')) > 0.9 * float(state_attr('sensor.electricity_price_hamretunet_10', 'max_price')) }}'
  action:
   - service: notify.pushbullet
     data:
       title: "Electricity price"
       target: "device/daniel_telefon_cat"
       message: "The electricity price is now {{ states('sensor.electricity_price_hamretunet_10') }}"
```



{% endraw %}
