The **Downloader** {% term integration %} provides a service to download files. It will raise an error and not continue to set itself up when the download directory does not exist. The directory needs to be writable for the user that is running Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

If the path is not absolute, itâ€™s assumed to be relative to the Home Assistant configuration directory (for example, .homeassistant/downloads).

### Use the service

Go to the "Developer Tools", then to "Services", and choose `downloader/download_file` from the list of available services. Fill the "Service Data" field as shown in the example below and hit "CALL SERVICE".

```json
{"url":"http://domain.tld/path/to/file"}
```

This will download the file from the given URL.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `url`                  |       no | The URL of the file to download.               |
| `subdir`               |      yes | Download into subdirectory of **download_dir** |
| `filename`             |      yes | Determine the filename.                        |
| `overwrite`            |      yes | Whether to overwrite the file or not, defaults to `false`. |

### Download status events

When a download finished successfully, Home Assistant will emit a `downloader_download_completed` event to the event bus which you can use to write automations against.
In case download failed another event `downloader_download_failed` is emitted to indicate that the download did not complete successfully.

Along with the event the following payload parameters are available:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `url`  | The `url` that was requested.|                                                                                                                                      
| `filename`    | The `name` of the file that was being downloaded.|

#### Example automation:
