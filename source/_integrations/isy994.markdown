The ISY994 is a home automation controller that is capable of controlling Insteon and X10 devices. Some models of the ISY994 can even control Z-Wave devices.
The ISY994 controller is manufactured by [Universal Devices](https://www.universal-devices.com/smarthome).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Climate
- Cover
- Light
- Fan
- Lock
- Sensor
- Switch

Home Assistant is capable of communicating with any binary sensor, cover, fan, light, lock, sensor and switch that is configured on the controller. Using the programs on the controller, custom binary sensors, cover, fan, lock, and switches can also be created.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Manual configuration

You may also configure the integration manually by adding the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
isy994:
  host: ISY_ADDRESS
  username: ISY_USERNAME
  password: ISY_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
host:
description: The host entry should be in full URL format, e.g., `http://192.168.10.100:80`
required: true
type: string
username:
description: The username that used to access the ISY interface.
required: true
type: string
password:
description: The password that used to access the ISY interface.
required: true
type: string
sensor_string:
description: This is the string that is used to identify which devices are to be assumed to be sensors instead of lights of switches. If this string is found in the device name or folder, Home Assistant will assume it is as a sensor or binary sensor (if the device has on/off or true/false states). This is only necessary for nodes that are not automatically detected as sensors by Home Assistant. Insteon door, window, motion and leak sensors should all be detected automatically.
required: false
type: string
default: sensor
variable_sensor_string:
description: This is the string that is used to identify which Integer or State Variables are to be added as sensors. If this string is found in the device name, Home Assistant will assume it is as a sensor.
required: false
type: string
default: sensor
ignore_string:
description: Any devices that contain this string in their name (or folder path) will be ignored by Home Assistant. They will not become entities at all and will not fire `control_events`.
required: false
type: string
default: {IGNORE ME}
tls:
description: This entry should reflect the version of TLS that the ISY controller is using for HTTPS encryption. This value can be either 1.1 or 1.2. If this value is not set, it is assumed to be version 1.1. This is the default for most users. ISY994 Pro users may likely be using 1.2. When using HTTPS in the host entry, it is best practice to set this value.
required: false
type: string
restore_light_state:
description: If disabled (default behavior), lights turned ON from Home Assistant without a `brightness` parameter set, will turn on to the `on_level` set within the physical device. For example, on Insteon devices this would be the same brightness as if the switch/device was turned ON. If this setting is enabled, lights that are turned on from Home Assistant will go to the last known brightness value. Both the `on_level` and `last_brightness` values are available as attributes if needed for device-specific customization.
required: false
type: boolean
default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

Once the ISY controller is configured, it will automatically import any binary sensors, covers, fans, lights, locks, sensors and switches it can locate.

### Sensors

An Insteon door/window sensor will show up as a single Binary Sensor rather than two discrete devices like it does in the ISY994 admin panel. Note that when in "Two Nodes" mode, the sensor will have an UNKNOWN state until the sensor changes for the first time since the last Home Assistant reboot. If you do not use Insteon scenes that are controlled directly from the door sensor, you may prefer to set the sensor to "One Node" mode using the ISY Admin Panel.

Each Insteon leak sensor will also show up as a single Binary Sensor as opposed to the two nodes seen in the ISY994. The name of the device will be based on what the parent node is named in the ISY994, which is typically the one with "-Dry" at the end of the name. This may be confusing, because "On" means wet in Home Assistant. You can rename this node in Home Assistant to be more clear, see the [Customization section](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/) of your configuration.

If your leak or door/window sensor supports heartbeats, a new binary_sensor device will be added to Home Assistant to represent the battery state. The sensor will stay "Off" so long as the daily heartbeats occur. If a heartbeat is missed, the sensor will flip to "On". The name of this device will be based on the heartbeat node in the ISY.

Integer and State Variables from the ISY can be used as sensors by setting the `variable_sensor_string` and adding it as part of the variable name in the ISY. For example, if you have a variable named `HA.my_variable` and a `variable_sensor_string` of `"HA."`, it will be automatically added as a `sensor` in Home Assistant.

### Handling Insteon or Other ISY Control Events

A Home Assistant `isy994_control` event is emitted for every "control" event in the ISY's device network (as long as the device has not been ignored or disabled in Home Assistant). This allows you to write automations that trigger based on events such as Insteon button presses. You can also trigger off of the unique Insteon/Zigbee/Z-Wave events, such as double-presses, long-holds etc.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "turn off living room on double tap lightswitch"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: isy994_control
      event_data:
        entity_id: light.lr_track_lights_front
        control: "DFON"
        value: 255
        formatted: "On"
        uom: "100"
        prec: "0"
    action:
      service: light.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: light.lr_track_lights_rear
```

All `isy994_control` events will have an `entity_id` and `control` parameter in its `event_data`. You'll need to refer to ISY994 documentation for the list of every possible control type, but the common ones are:

- `DON`: On button.
- `DOF`: Off button.
- `DFON`: "Fast On", usually from double-tapping an On button.
- `DFOF`: "Fast Off", usually from double-tapping an Off button.
- `FDUP`: "Fade Up", usually while holding down an On button.
- `FDDOWN`: "Fade Down", usually while holding down an Off button.
- `FDSTOP`: "Fade Stop", when releasing a long-held button.
- `BRT`: "Brighten", from controllers that issue a single command to slightly brighten a light.
- `DIM`: "Dim", from controllers that issue a single command to slightly dim a light.

### Insteon Scenes & Keypad/Remote Buttons

All Insteon scenes configured in the ISY994 will show up as a `switch` in Home Assistant, as they do not support dimming or setting specific brightness settings as Home Assisstant's `light` component.

Insteon Secondary Keypad buttons and Remote buttons are added to Home Assistant to allow support for using Control Events in Automations. These devices are added as `sensors` since they cannot be directly controlled (turned on/off); their state is the last ON level command they sent, in a range from `0` (Off) to `255` (On 100%). Note: these devices may report incorrect states before being used after a reboot of the ISY. Secondary Keypad buttons may be turned on or off using ISY Scenes (refer to ISY Documentation for more details).

### Services

Once loaded, the following services will be exposed with the `isy994.` prefix, to allow advanced control over the ISY and its connected devices:

- Entity services for Home Assistant-connected entities: `send_node_command`, `send_raw_node_command`, `set_on_level`, and `set_ramp_rate`.
- Generic ISY services: `system_query`, `set_variable`, `send_program_command`, and `run_network_resource`.
- Management services for the ISY994 Home Assistant integration: `reload` and `cleanup_entities`.

#### Service `isy994.reload`

Reload the ISY994 connection(s) without restarting Home Assistant. Use this service to pick up new devices that have been added or changed on the ISY since the last restart of Home Assistant.

#### Service `isy994.cleanup_entities`

Cleanup old entities no longer used by the ISY994 integrations. Useful if you've removed devices from the ISY or changed the filter string options in the configuration to exclude additional items and they were not properly removed
by Home Assistant.

### Creating Custom Devices using ISY Programs

Using the Programs tab in the controller's Administrative Console, custom devices can be created that will appear natively inside of Home Assistant. Home Assistant will scan the following folders and build the device to the associated domains:

```text
My Programs
├── HA.binary_sensor
|   ├── Movement In House
|   |   └── status
|   └── Garage Open
|   |   └── status
├── HA.cover
|   ├── Left Garage Door
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
|   ├── Living Room Blinds
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
├── HA.fan
|   ├── Desk Fan
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
|   ├── Living Room Fan
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
├── HA.lock
|   ├── Front Door
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
|   ├── Back Door
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
├── HA.switch
|   ├── Dining Lights
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
|   ├── Sleep Mode
|   |   ├── actions
|   |   └── status
```

A device is created by creating a directory, with the name for the device, under any of the following root directories:

- _HA.binary_sensor_ will create a binary sensor (see [Customizing Devices](/getting-started/customizing-devices/) to set the sensor class).
- _HA.cover_ will create a cover.
- _HA.fan_ will create a fan.
- _HA.lock_ will create a lock.
- _HA.switch_ will create a switch.

A program, named _status_, is required under the program device directory. A program, named _actions_, is required for all program devices except for binary*sensor. Any other programs in these device directories will be ignored. The \_status* program requires that you create a variable with the name of your choice. This variable will store the actual status of the new device and will be updated by the _action_ program.

  <img src='/images/isy994/isy994_CoverExample.png' />
</p>

The _status_ program in this directory is what indicates the state of the device:

- _binary_sensor_ on if the clause returns true, otherwise off.
- _cover_ closed if the clause returns true, otherwise open.
- _fan_ on if the clause returns true, otherwise off.
- _lock_ locked if the clause returns true, otherwise unlocked.
- _switch_ on if the clause returns true, otherwise off.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/isy994/isy994_SwitchStatusExample.png' />
</p>

The _actions_ program indicates what should be performed for the following device services:

- _cover_ the THEN clause is evaluated for the open_cover service, the ELSE clause is evaluated for the close_cover service.
- _fan_ the THEN clause is evaluated for the turn_on service, the ELSE clause is evaluated for the turn_off service.
- _lock_ the THEN clause is evaluated for the lock service, the ELSE clause is evaluated for the unlock service.
- _switch_ the THEN clause is evaluated for the turn_on service, the ELSE clause is evaluated for the turn_off service.

The example program above shows how to control a legacy X10 device from Home Assistant using an ISY controller.
