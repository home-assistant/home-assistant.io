The `linksys_smart` platform offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a Linksys Smart Wi-Fi based router.

Tested routers:

- Linksys WRT3200ACM MU-MIMO Gigabit Wi-Fi Wireless Router
- Linksys WRT1900ACS Dual-band Wi-Fi Router
- Linksys EA6900 AC1900 Dual-Band Wi-Fi Router
- Linksys EA8300 Max-Stream AC2200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi Router

## Setup

For this platform to work correctly, it is necessary to disable the "Access via wireless" feature in the Local Management Access section of the router administration page. If "Access via wireless" is not disabled, a connectivity conflict arises because the Home Assistant integration is trying to pass userid and password, but the router is only expecting a password.

## Configuration

To use a Linksys Smart Wi-Fi Router in your Home Assistant installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: linksys_smart
    host: 192.168.1.1
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The hostname or IP address of your router, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.
