The `geo_rss_events` sensor retrieves events from a GeoRSS feed and shows information of those events filtered by distance to Home Assistant's location and grouped by category.

This sensor is particularly useful if events occur unexpectedly in the vicinity of the home while the GeoRSS feed also contains many events representing distant unrelated entries. Typical examples are bush fires alerts or earthquakes.

</p>

The reference point for comparing the distance is by default defined by `latitude` and `longitude` in the basic configuration.

Only entries of the feed are considered that define a location as `point` or `polygon` in *georss.org* format or as *WGS84 latitude/longitude*.

The data is updated every 5 minutes.

## Configuration

To enable the GeoRSS events sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`. This is an example configuration showing bush fire incidents from the NSW Rural Fire Service.

```yaml
