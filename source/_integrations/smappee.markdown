The Smappee {% term integration %} will allow users to integrate their Smappee monitors, Smappee Comfort Plugs and Smappee Switches into Home Assistant using the [official cloud API](https://smappee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVAPI/overview) or the limited local option.

## Smappee monitors

The table below summarizes the available options to initiate the Smappee integration in Home Assistant per Smappee monitor type.

| Monitor type          | Local discovery | Cloud API |
| --------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Smappee Energy        | Yes             | Yes       |
| Smappee Solar         | Yes             | Yes       |
| Smappee Plus          | Yes             | Yes       |
| Smappee Pro           | Yes             | Yes       |
| Smappee Genius        | Yes             | Yes       |
| Smappee Connect       | No              | Yes       |
| Smappee Wi-Fi Connect | No              | Yes       |
| Smappee P1/S1 module  | No              | Yes       |

## Local discovery

In most cases, the Smappee Energy, Solar, Plus, Pro and Genius monitors will be automatically discovered by Home Assistant through network scanning.
Those automatically discovered Smappee devices are listed on the integrations page and can be configured without any additional details.
This will provide you a limited number of entities only.
If your home network doesn't support mDNS you can still manually initiate the Smappee integration by choosing the LOCAL option and entering the IP address of the Smappee monitor through the configuration flow.

Technical note: Auto-discovery of Smappee device requires that its mDNS name and password are set to factory default values. These values are typically accessed on the device expert web portal (locally at http://[IP-Address]/smappee.html). If you have changed the mDNS name, this typically is "Smappee[serialnumber]".

### Sensor
A sensor entity is being added for the current active power usage. In case of solar production, an entity for active power production is added as well.

Smappee Genius devices will also provide entities for the current reactive, voltages for each phase and current active powers for each configured load (submeter).

### Switch

Switch entities are created for each Smappee Switch and Smappee Comfort Plug.


## Cloud API configuration

To use the Smappee cloud integration you need a personal `client_id` and `client_secret` and add these to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file. For personal use, access to the API is free and credentials can be obtained by contacting [support@smappee.com](mailto:support@smappee.com). For commercial usage, it is based on a recurring fee and credentials can be obtained by contacting [info@smappee.com](mailto:info@smappee.com).
For any information about the use of the API please refer to the [Smappee API space](https://smappee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVAPI/overview).

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
smappee:
  client_id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
  client_secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Once Home Assistant restarted, go to Settings > Devices & Services and select the Smappee integration. You will be redirected to a login page and be able to select the locations you would like to use within Home Assistant.

Using the Smappee cloud integration allows you to access your Smappee monitor and other shared devices from outside your local network. Additionally a number of (binary) sensor entities become available as well.

### Sensor

Sensor entities are being added for the current active power usage,
the always-on active power, today's total consumption,
total consumption during the current hour, total consumption during the last 5 minutes
and the always-on (slumber) consumption from today. In case of solar production, entities for the active power production, today's total solar production
and the solar production during the current hour are added as well.

Smappee Pro, Plus, Genius and Connect devices will create current active powers for each configured load (submeter).

In case a Smappee Gas and/or Water meter is installed as well, an entity showing today's consumption is provided.

Additionally, Smappee, Genius and Connect devices will also provide entities for the line voltages and phase voltages (for each phase).

### Switch

Switch entities are created for each Smappee Switch, Smappee Comfort Plug and Smappee Output module.

### Binary sensor

For each discovered NILM appliance a binary sensor is being added showing the current state of the appliance.
