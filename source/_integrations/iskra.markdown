The [Iskra](https://www.iskra.eu/) {% term integration %} allows you to connect Iskra energy meters and power quality analyzers to Home Assistant. Data is polled using Modbus TCP or the Iskra Smart Gateway's REST API.

## Supported devices

### Energy meters

Most Iskra's DIN rail mountable energy meters support Modbus RTU over RS485 and IR. To integrate them, you will need a Modbus TCP gateway or Iskra's Smart Gateway:

- Impact series ([IE38XX / IE14XX](https://www.iskra.eu/en/Iskra-Energy-meters/))
- WM series ([WM3XX / WM1XX](https://www.iskra.eu/en/Iskra-Energy-meters/))

### Power quality analyzers

These devices typically support Ethernet connections and use Modbus TCP for data polling:

- iMT/MT series ([MTXXX / iMTXXX](https://www.iskra.eu/en/NEW_SERIES_Universal_measuring_devices_/))
- iMC/MC series ([MCXXX / iMCXXX](https://www.iskra.eu/en/NEW_SERIES_Universal_measuring_devices_/))

## Configuration options

There are two ways to configure your devices with Home Assistant:
- [Using a Smart Gateway with REST API](#smart-gateway-with-rest-api)
- [Using a Modbus TCP connection](#modbus-tcp-connection)

### Smart Gateway with REST API

If your device supports Modbus RTU over RS485/IR, you can use Iskra's Smart Gateway to connect them via the REST API:

- **Smart Gateway**: Connect your devices to the Smart Gateway and add your devices to the Smart Gateway's configuration. It's also recommended to set a static IP on your smart gateway.
- **Home Assistant**: Add the Iskra integration, enter the Smart Gateway's **IP address**, and select **RestAPI** as the connection type within the Home Assistant integration. If authentication is required, Home Assistant will prompt you to enter the Smart Gateway's **credentials**. All devices configured on the Smart Gateway will be automatically added to your Home Assistant.

### Modbus TCP connection

If your device supports a direct internet connection, such as PQ meters (iMC/MC series/ iMT/MT series usually), you can use Modbus TCP:

- **Device**: Find your device using the [MiQen](https://www.iskra.si/sl/Programska-oprema/MiQen/) software and configure it to use a static IP.
- **Home Assistant**: Add the Iskra integration, enter the device's **IP address**, and select **Modbus TCP** as the connection type within the Home Assistant integration. Home Assistant will prompt you to enter the Modbus TCP port and Modbus address of your device.

## Sensors

The integration provides detailed information about power, current, and voltage for each phase. The data is updated every minute.
