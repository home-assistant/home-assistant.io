The `lacrosse` sensor {% term integration %} is using the data provided by a [Jeelink](https://www.digitalsmarties.net/products/jeelink) USB dongle or this [Arduino sketch](https://svn.fhem.de/trac/browser/trunk/fhem/contrib/arduino/36_LaCrosse-LaCrosseITPlusReader.zip).

## Tested devices

- Technoline TX 29 IT (temperature only)
- Technoline TX 29 DTH-IT (including humidity)
- TFA Dostmann LaCrosse sensors (type 30.3147.IT)

## Setup

Since the sensor change their ID after each powercycle/battery change you can check what sensor IDs are available by using the command-line tool `pylacrosse` from the pylacrosse package.

```bash
sudo pylacrosse -d /dev/ttyUSB0 scan
```

Or, when using Docker containers:

```bash
docker exec -it <containername> pylacrosse -d /dev/ttyUSB0 scan
```

If you are using the Home Assistant OS or Supervised installation method, these
methods are not available for you. The use of an additional computer to figure
out the ID is advised.

For TX 29 DTH-IT sensors you can also read the ID from the display and calculate the ID as followed: `hex2dec(ID_on_display) / 4`.

## Configuration

To use your `lacrosse` compatible sensor in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: lacrosse
    sensors:
      sensor_identifier:
        type: SENSOR_TYPE
        id: SENSOR_ID
```

{% endconfiguration %}

## Examples

To setup a LaCrosse sensor with multiple sensors, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: lacrosse
    device: /dev/ttyUSB0
    baud: 57600
    sensors:
      kitchen_humidity:
        name: Kitchen Humidity
        type: humidity
        id: 72
      kitchen_temperature:
        name: Kitchen Temperature
        type: temperature
        id: 72
      kitchen_lacrosse_battery:
        name: Kitchen Sensor Battery
        type: battery
        id: 72
```
