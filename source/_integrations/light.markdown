This integration allows you to track and control various light bulbs. Read the integration documentation for your particular light hardware to learn how to enable it.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

### Default turn-on values

To set the default color, brightness and transition values when the light is turned on, create a custom `light_profiles.csv`, normally located in the default configuration folder where you find {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}.

The `light_profiles.csv` has to have a header. The format of the header is:

```txt
id,x,y,brightness,transition
```

The field transition is optional and can be omitted.

The `.default` suffix should be added to the entity identifier of each light to define a default value, e.g., for `light.ceiling_2` the `profile` field is `light.ceiling_2.default`. To define a default for all lights, the identifier `group.all_lights.default` can be used. Individual settings always supersede the `all_lights` default setting.

{% note %}
If a light entity is in the `on` state, the default profile brightness will only be applied if it is called in the service call data attribute `profile`, like any other named profile. The transition attribute will be applied for all `light.turn_on`, `light.toggle` and `light.turn_off` service calls, unless specified otherwise in the service call data.
{% endnote %}

### Service `light.turn_on`

Turns one light on or multiple lights on using [groups](/integrations/group/).

Most lights do not support all attributes. You can check the integration documentation of your particular light for hints, but in general, you will have to try things out and see what works.

To target all lights, set `entity_id` to `all`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `transition`           | yes      | Number that represents the time (in seconds) the light should take to transition to the new state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Light profiles define an xy color, brightness and a transition value (if no transition is desired, set to 0 or leave out the column entirely). If a profile is given, and a brightness is set, then the profile brightness will be overwritten. |

| `white`                | yes      | Set the light to white mode by setting this to `True`. Note that `white` does not have a corresponding state attribute, so the `color_mode` state attribute will be set to `white`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `effect`               | yes      | Applies an effect such as `colorloop` or `random`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

{% note %}
In order to apply attributes to an entity, you will need to add `data:` to the configuration. See example below
{% endnote %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
- id: one
  alias: "Turn on light when motion is detected"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_1
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.living_room
      data:
        brightness: 255
        kelvin: 2700
```
```yaml
# Ledlist morning on, red
- id: llmor
  alias: "Stair morning on"
  trigger:
  - at: '05:00'
    platform: time
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.ledliststair
      data:
        brightness: 130
        rgb_color: [255,0,0]
```
{% note %}
If no data is sent, and a default profile exists, the default profile will be applied.

### Service `light.turn_off`

Turns one or multiple lights off.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | String or list of strings that point at `entity_id`s of lights. To target all lights, set `entity_id` to `all`. |
| `transition`           | yes      | Integer that represents the time the light should take to transition to the new state in seconds.               |
| `flash`                | yes      | Tell light to flash, can be either value `short` or `long`.                                                     |

### Service `light.toggle`

Toggles the state of one or multiple lights. Takes the same arguments as the [`light.turn_on`](#service-lightturn_on) service.

*Note*: If `light.toggle` is used for a group of lights, it will toggle the individual state of each light. If you want the lights to be treated as a single light, use [Light Groups](/integrations/group#binary-sensor-light-and-switch-groups) instead.
