## Entities

The entities created by this integration depends on which source you set it up with (you can also set up the integration multiple times to use more sources).

### Sensor

For all sources the integration will create a [sensor](/integrations/sensor) entity that displays the newest version published to that source.

### Binary Sensor

For all sources (except for the ["Local installation"](#local-installation) source) the integration will create a [binary_sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor) entity that show if there is a newer version than the one you are currently running published to that source.
