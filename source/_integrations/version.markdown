## Entities

The entities created by this {% term integration %} depends on which source you set it up with (you can also set up the {% term integration %} multiple times to use more sources).

### Sensor

For all sources the {% term integration %} will create a [sensor](/integrations/sensor) {% term entity %} that displays the newest version published to that source.

### Binary Sensor

For all sources (except for the ["Local installation"](#local-installation) source) the {% term integration %} will create a [binary_sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor) {% term entity %} that show if there is a newer version than the one you are currently running published to that source.
