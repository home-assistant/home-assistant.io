The Tailwind integration integrates [Tailwind](https://gotailwind.com/)
garage door controllers fully locally.

This integration has been tested with the following Tailwind devices:

- [Tailwind iQ3](https://gotailwind.com/products/iq3-smart-garage-controller)

## Prerequisites

To use your Tailwind device with Home Assistant, you need to have your Tailwind
device setup, connected to your network, and configured in the Tailwind app.

You will need two pieces of information:

- **The IP address of your Tailwind device.** You can find the IP address by
  going into the Tailwind app and selecting your Tailwind device's cog icon.
  The IP address is shown in the **Device Info** section.
- **Local control key token.** To find local control key token, browse to the
  [Tailwind web portal][token], log in with your Tailwind account, and select
  the [**Local Control Key**][token] tab. The 6-digit number shown is your
  local control key token.

## Provided entities

The Tailwind integration provides a cover entity for each garage door that is
connected to your Tailwind garage door controller.

Using the cover entity, you can open and close your garage door and see the
current state of your garage door.

Additionally, the integration provides the following entities:

- **Identify** - A button entity that allows you to identify your Tailwind
  device by flashing the status LED on the device.
- **Operational status** - A binary sensor entity that shows the operational
  status of your Tailwind device.
- **Status LED brightness control** - A number entity that allows you to control
  the brightness of the status LED on the Tailwind device.
