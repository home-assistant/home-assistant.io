This `hikvisioncam` switch {% term integration %} allows you to control your motion detection setting on your [Hikvision](https://www.hikvision.com/) camera.

<div class='note warning'>
Currently works using default https port only.
</div>

To use your Hikvision cam in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: hikvisioncam
    host: 192.168.1.32
```

In the Hikvision camera settings you also need to make a few changes:
- In the camera menu navigate to Network >> Advanced Settings >> Integration Protocol. Check the 'Enable Hikvision-CGI' box and set the 'Hikvision-CGI Authentication' to 'digest/basic'.
- Make sure the camera user has the rights to change parameter settings. In the menu navigate to System Settings >> User Management >> User Management. Select the correct user, click 'Modify' en check the 'Remote: Parameters Settings' box.
