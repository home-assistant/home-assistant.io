Keeps track on `number` entities in your environment, their state, and allows you to control them. This integration allows other integrations to get a value input from user within a range.

If you are looking for a way to create a number entity, please take a look at the [Number helper](/integrations/input_number).

## Device class

The type of data a number represents impacts how it is displayed in the frontend. This is controlled by the number's device class designation. Built-in numbers and many created from an integration will have this designation predefined. Those can be modified in the [customize section](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/). When manually creating a new number the device class may be optionally assigned. A full list of available number device classes is below:

- **None**: Generic number. This is the default and doesn't need to be set.
- **apparent_power**: Apparent power in VA.
- **aqi**: Air Quality Index (unitless).
- **atmospheric_pressure**: Atmospheric pressure in cbar, bar, hPa, inHg, kPa, mbar, Pa, psi
- **battery**: Percentage of battery that is left
- **carbon_dioxide**: Carbon Dioxide in CO2 (Smoke)
- **carbon_monoxide**: Carbon Monoxide in CO (Gas CNG/LPG)
- **current**: Current in A, mA
- **data_rate**: Data rate in bit/s, kbit/s, Mbit/s, Gbit/s, B/s, kB/s, MB/s, GB/s, KiB/s, MiB/s, or GiB/s
