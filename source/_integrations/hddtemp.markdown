The `hddtemp` sensor {% term integration %} is using the data provided by [HDDTemp](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/hddtemp).

## Setup

It required that `hddtemp` is started or running in daemon mode on a local or remote system.

```bash
hddtemp -dF
```

{% important %}
You can't use this sensor in a container (only Home Assistant Core is supported) as it requires access to `hddtemp` which is not available in a container-based setup.

## Configuration

To setup a HDDTemp to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: hddtemp
    disks:

```
