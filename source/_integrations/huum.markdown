Integrates [Huum](https://huum.eu/) saunas into Home Assistant.

Youâ€™ll need your username (which is usually your email) and password to configure the integration.

The integration takes the same security measures regarding an open sauna door as the Huum app.
If the sauna door is open, the sauna will not turn on.

{% note %}
When the sauna is off, you must turn on the sauna after setting the temperature.
This is as a security measure so that one does not turn on the
sauna by mistake.
