The `russound_rio` {% term integration %} allows you to control Russound devices that make use of the RIO protocol.

The platform automatically discovers all enabled zones and sources. Each zone is added as a media player device with the enabled sources available as inputs. Media information is supported if the selected source reports it.

To add a device to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: russound_rio
    host: 192.168.1.10
    name: Russound
```

{% configuration %}
