The `xiaomi_tv` {% term integration %} allows you to control a [Xiaomi TV](https://www.mi.com/global/mitv3s/65flat/).
The Xiaomi TV integration only supports Xiaomi TVs running MIUI.

You need to make sure the TV is connected to the internet, and that your Home Assistant instance is on the same network.

To add a TV to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: xiaomi_tv
```

{% important %}
When starting or restarting Home Assistant make sure your TV is off. This is a flaw in the TV itself.

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "The IP of the Xiaomi TV, e.g., `192.168.0.10`."
  required: false
  type: string
name:
  description: The name to use on the frontend.
  required: false
  default: Xiaomi TV
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

If you do not set a host in the configuration file, local TVs will automatically be discovered.

To manually add a TV you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: xiaomi_tv
    host: YOUR_TV_IP
    name: YOUR_TV_NAME
```

{% note %}
The platform will never turn your TV off. Instead, it will be put to sleep and woken up. This can be useful, because the selected source of the TV will remain the same. It will essentially turn your TV into a dumb TV.
{% endnote %}
