The `kodi` platform allows you to control a [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) multimedia system from Home Assistant.

The preferred way to set up the Kodi platform is through discovery, which requires an enabled [web interface](https://kodi.wiki/view/Web_interface) on your Kodi installation.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Media player](#configuration)
- [Notifications](#notifications)

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

If you previously had Kodi configured through {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}, it's advisable to remove it, and configure from the UI.
If you do not remove it, your configuration will be imported with the following limitations:
- Your turn on/off actions will not be imported. This functionality is now available through device triggers.
- You may have duplicate entities.
- Kodi must be on when Home Assistant is loading for the first time for the configuration to be imported.

### Turning On/Off

You can customize your turn on and off actions through automations. Simply use the relevant Kodi device triggers and your automation will be called to perform the `turn_on` or `turn_off` sequence; see the [Kodi turn on/off samples](#kodi-turn-onoff-samples) section for scripts that can be used.

These automations can be configured through the UI (see [device triggers](/docs/automation/trigger/#device-triggers) for automations).  If you prefer YAML, you'll need to get the device ID from the UI automation editor.  Automations would be of the form:

```yaml
automation:
  - id: kodi_turn_on
    alias: "Kodi: turn on"
    trigger:
      - platform: device
        device_id: !secret kodi_device_id
        domain: kodi
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        type: turn_on
    action:
      - service: script.kodi_turn_on

  - id: kodi_turn_off
    alias: "Kodi: turn off"
    trigger:
      - platform: device
        device_id: !secret kodi_device_id
        domain: kodi
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        type: turn_off
    action:
      - service: script.kodi_turn_off
```

### Services

#### Service `kodi.add_to_playlist`

Add music to the default playlist (i.e., playlistid=0).

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | Name(s) of the Kodi entities where to add the media.                                                                                                     |
| `media_type`           | yes      | Media type identifier. It must be one of SONG or ALBUM.                                                                                                  |
| `media_id`             | no       | Unique Id of the media entry to add (`songid` or `albumid`). If not defined, `media_name` and `artist_name` are needed to search the Kodi music library. |
| `media_name`           | no       | Optional media name for filtering media. Can be 'ALL' when `media_type` is 'ALBUM' and `artist_name` is specified, to add all songs from one artist.     |
| `artist_name`          | no       | Optional artist name for filtering media.                                                                                                                |

#### Service `kodi.call_method`

Call a [Kodi JSON-RPC API](https://kodi.wiki/?title=JSON-RPC_API) method with optional parameters. Results of the Kodi API call will be redirected in a Home Assistant event: `kodi_call_method_result`.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | Name(s) of the Kodi entities where to run the API method. |
| `method`               | yes      | Name of the Kodi JSON-RPC API method to be called.        |
| any other parameter    | no       | Optional parameters for the Kodi API call.                |

### Event triggering

When calling the `kodi.call_method` service, if the Kodi JSON-RPC API returns data, when received by Home Assistant it will fire a `kodi_call_method_result` event on the event bus with the following `event_data`:

```yaml
entity_id: "<Kodi media_player entity_id>"
result_ok: <boolean>
input: <input parameters of the service call>
result: <data received from the Kodi API>
```

### Kodi turn on/off samples

The following scripts can be used in automations for turning on/off your Kodi instance; see [Turning on/off](#turning-onoff).  You could also simply use these sequences directly in the automations without creating scripts.

#### Turn on Kodi with Wake on LAN

With this configuration, when calling `media_player/turn_on` on the Kodi device, a _magic packet_ will be sent to the specified MAC address. To use this service, first you need to configuration the [`wake_on_lan`](/integrations/wake_on_lan) integration in Home Assistant, which is achieved simply by adding `wake_on_lan:` to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}.

```yaml
script:
  turn_on_kodi_with_wol:
    sequence:
      - service: wake_on_lan.send_magic_packet
        data:
          mac: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
          broadcast_address: 192.168.255.255
```

#### Turn off Kodi with API calls

Here are the equivalent ways to configure each of the old options to turn off Kodi (`quit`, `hibernate`, `suspend`, `reboot`, or `shutdown`):

- **Quit** method

```yaml
script:
  kodi_quit:
    sequence:
      - service: kodi.call_method
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
        data:
          method: Application.Quit
```

- **Hibernate** method

```yaml
script:
  kodi_hibernate:
    sequence:
      - service: kodi.call_method
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
        data:
          method: System.Hibernate
```

- **Suspend** method

```yaml
script:
  kodi_suspend:
    sequence:
      - service: kodi.call_method
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
        data:
          method: System.Suspend
```

- **Reboot** method

```yaml
script:
  kodi_reboot:
    sequence:
      - service: kodi.call_method
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
        data:
          method: System.Reboot
```

- **Shutdown** method

```yaml
script:
  kodi_shutdown:
    sequence:
      - service: kodi.call_method
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
        data:
          method: System.Shutdown
```

#### Turn on and off the TV with the Kodi JSON-CEC Add-on

For Kodi devices running 24/7 attached to a CEC capable TV (OSMC / OpenElec and systems alike running in Rasperry Pi's, for example), this configuration enables the optimal way to turn on/off the attached TV from Home Assistant while Kodi is always active and ready:

```yaml
script:
  turn_on_kodi_with_cec:
  sequence:
    - service: kodi.call_method
      target:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
      data:
        method: Addons.ExecuteAddon
        addonid: script.json-cec
        params:
          command: activate

  turn_off_kodi_with_cec:
    sequence:
      - service: media_player.media_stop
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
      - service: kodi.call_method
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
        data:
          method: Addons.ExecuteAddon
          addonid: script.json-cec
          params:
            command: standby
```

{% important %}
This example and the following requires to have the [script.json-cec](https://github.com/joshjowen/script.json-cec) plugin installed on your Kodi player. It'll also expose the endpoints standby, toggle and activate without authentication on your Kodi player. Use this with caution.

To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).

## Keypress events

key presses of keyboards/remotes can be overwritten in Kodi and configured to send an event to Home Assistant, which can then be used in automations to, for instance, turn up/down the volume of a TV/receiver.

A keypress can be overwritten in Kodi by using the [Kodi keymap XML](https://kodi.wiki/view/Keymap) or from within the Kodi GUI using the [Keymap Editor add-on](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Keymap_Editor).

An example of the Kodi keymap configuration using XML, which will overwrite the volume_up/volume_down buttons and instead send an event to HomeAssistant:

```xml
<keymap>
  <global>
    <keyboard>
      <volume_up>NotifyAll("KodiLivingroom", "OnKeyPress", {"key":"volume_up"})</volume_up>
      <volume_down>NotifyAll("KodiLivingroom", "OnKeyPress", {"key":"volume_down"})</volume_down>
    </keyboard>
  </global>
</keymap>
```

The `"KodiLivingroom"` can be set to any value and will be present in the event data as the `"sender"`
The `"OnKeyPress"` is needed to identify the event in Home Assistant, do not change this.
The `{"key":"volume_up"}` can contain any JSON which will be present in the event data under the `"data"` key, normally this is used to identify which key was pressed.

For possible keyboard key names, see: https://kodi.wiki/view/List_of_keynames
For other actions, see: https://kodi.wiki/view/Keymap#Keynames

For the example above, when the volume up key is pressed, an event in Home Assistant will be fired that looks like this:
```yaml
event_type: kodi_keypress
data:
  type: keypress
  device_id: 72e5g0ay5621f5d719qd8cydj943421a
  entity_id: media_player.kodi_livingroom
  sender: KodiLivingroom
  data:
    key: volume_up
```

A example of a automation to turn up/down the volume of a receiver using the event:

{% raw %}

```yaml
alias: Kodi keypress
mode: parallel
max: 10
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: kodi_keypress
    event_data:
      entity_id: media_player.kodi_livingroom
action:
  - choose:
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{trigger.event.data.data.key=='volume_up'}}"
        sequence:
          - service: media_player.volume_up
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.receiver
      - conditions:
          - condition: template
            value_template: "{{trigger.event.data.data.key=='volume_down'}}"
        sequence:
          - service: media_player.volume_down
            target:
              entity_id: media_player.receiver
```

{% endraw %}
