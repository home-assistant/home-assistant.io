The `juicenet` platform pulls data from a [JuiceNet](https://evcharging.enelx.com/products/juicebox) charging station equipped with a Wi-Fi connection. It will access and make available all of the devices attached to your account. It also exposes a switch allowing you to charge your car now instead of waiting for the pre-set schedule.
