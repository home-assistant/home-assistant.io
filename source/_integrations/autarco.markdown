The **Autarco** {% term integration %} allows you to gather data from the cloud API of [Autarco](https://www.autarco.com) and use it in Home Assistant.

Autarco is a Dutch company that provides solar panels, inverters and batteries. They have their own cloud platform where you can monitor the performance of your system.

## Sensors

The Autarco platform mainly provides sensors that you can use in your [energy dashboard](/energy).

### Solar

Gain insight into how much solar energy your site produces.

- Power production (W)
- Energy production today (kWh)
- Energy production this month (kWh)
- Energy production total (kWh)

### Inverters

Gain insight into how much energy an inverter produces. The integration will create a device for each inverter linked to your account.

- AC output power (W)
- AC output energy total (kWh)

### Battery

If you have a battery connected to your system, you can monitor the battery status and see how much energy it charges or discharges.

- Power flow (W) - Positive values indicate charging, negative values indicate discharging
- State of charge (%)
- Discharged energy today (kWh)
- Discharged energy this month (kWh)
- Discharged energy total (kWh)
- Charged energy today (kWh)
- Charged energy this month (kWh)
- Charged energy total (kWh)
