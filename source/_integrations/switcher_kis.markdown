This `Switcher` integration allows you to control your [Switcher Devices](https://www.switcher.co.il/).

Supported devices:

- Switcher Power Plug
- Switcher Touch (from firmware 1.51)
- Switcher V2 (Espressif chipset - from firmware 3.21)
- Switcher V2 (Qualcomm chipset - from firmware 72.32)
- Switcher V4
- Switcher Breeze
- Switcher Runner

If you completed the integration setup but are still unable to control the device, please make sure your device's firmware is up-to-date.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Buttons

For Switcher Breeze the integration provides the following buttons:

- For devices that are also controlled in other ways or often go out of sync with Switcher Breeze, there are `Assume on` & `Assume off` buttons which you can use to can tell Switcher Breeze if your device is currently running or not without sending a new command to the device.

- For devices which do not support swing status for the vertical swing, the integration provides separate `Vertical swing on` & `Vertical swing off` buttons.

## Sensors

For Switcher power control devices (Switcher Power Plug, Switcher Touch, Switcher V2/V4) the integration provides the following sensors:
| Sensor Name         | Description                                            | Example           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `Auto Shutdown`*    | The auto shutdown time limit configured on the device  | 01:30:00          |
| `Remaining Time`*   | Time remaining to shutdown (auto or timer)             | 01:29:41          |
| `Electric Current`  | The electric current in amps                           | 12.5 A            |
| `Power Consumption` | The power consumption in watts                         | 2756 W            |

## Services

For Switcher power control devices (Switcher Touch, Switcher V2/V4) the integration provides the following sensors:

### Service: `switcher_kis.set_auto_off`

You can use the `switcher_kis.set_auto_off` service to set the auto-off configuration setting for the device.

Meaning the device will turn itself off when reaching the auto-off configuration limit.

| Service Field | Mandatory | Description                                                                            | Example                    |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `entity_id`   | Yes       | Name of the entity id associated with the integration, used for permission validation  | switch.switcher_kis_boiler |
| `auto_off`    | Yes       | Time period string containing hours and minutes                                        | "02:30"                    |

### Service: `switcher_kis.turn_on_with_timer`

You can use the `switcher_kis.turn_on_with_timer` service to turn on the switcher device with timer.

Meaning the device will turn itself off when timer ends.
Note: This does not affect the auto off timer.
| Service Field | Mandatory | Description                                                                            | Example                    |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `entity_id`   | Yes       | Name of the entity id associated with the integration, used for permission validation  | switch.switcher_kis_boiler |
| `timer_minutes`    | Yes       | Integer containing timer minutes (valid range 1 to 150)                                      | 90                    |

## Notes

Make sure that Home Assistant host's firewall allows incoming traffic on UDP ports 10002, 20002 & 20003 and outgoing connections to Switcher device(s) on TCP ports 9957 & 10000.
If Home Assistant and the Switcher device(s) are not on the same network, you will also need to have their traffic properly forwarded between the two networks.
