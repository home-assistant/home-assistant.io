The **Local file** camera {% term integration %} allows you to integrate an image file from disk into Home Assistant as a camera. If the image is updated on the file system, the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated. The `local_file.update_file_path` action can be used to update the image using an automation.

The `local_file` camera can for example be used with various camera platforms that save a temporary images locally. It can also be used to display a graph that you render periodically and will then be displayed in Home Assistant.

{% note %}
The file path must be added to [allowlist_external_dirs](/integrations/homeassistant/#allowlist_external_dirs) for the integration to be able to read it.
