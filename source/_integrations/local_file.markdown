The **Local file** camera {% term integration %} allows you to integrate an image file from disk into Home Assistant as a camera. If the image is updated on the file system the image displayed in Home Assistant will also be updated. The service `local_file.update_file_path` can be used to update the image using an automation.

The `local_file` camera can for example be used with various camera platforms that save a temporary images locally. It can also be used to display a graph that you render periodically and will then be displayed in Home Assistant.
