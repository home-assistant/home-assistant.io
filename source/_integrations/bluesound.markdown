### Service `bluesound.join`

Group players together under a single master speaker. That will make a new group or join an existing group.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                               |

| `entity_id`            | no       | String or list of a single `entity_id` that will group to master speaker. |

### Service `bluesound.unjoin`

Remove one or more speakers from a group of speakers. If no `entity_id` is provided, all speakers are unjoined.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                      |

### Service `bluesound.set_sleep_timer`

Sets a timer that will turn off the speaker. For each time you call this it will increase the time by one step. The steps are (in minutes): 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 0.
If you increase an ongoing timer of for example 13 minutes, it will increase it to 15. If the timer is set to 90, it will remove the time (hence the 0).
