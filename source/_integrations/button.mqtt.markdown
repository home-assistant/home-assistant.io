The `mqtt` button platform lets you send an MQTT message when the button is pressed in the frontend or the button press service is called. This can be used to expose some service of a remote device, for example reboot.

## Configuration

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  button:
    - command_topic: "home/bedroom/switch1/reboot"
```

<a id='new_format'></a>

{% details "Previous configuration format" %}

The configuration format of manual configured MQTT items has changed.
The old format that places configurations under the `button` platform key
should no longer be used and is deprecated.

The above example shows the new and modern way,
this is the previous/old example:

```yaml
button:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: "home/bedroom/switch1/reboot"
```

{% enddetails %}

Make sure that your topic matches exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

## Examples

In this section, you will find some real-life examples of how to use this feature.

### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a button.

```yaml

    - unique_id: bedroom_switch_reboot_btn
      name: "Restart Bedroom Switch"
      command_topic: "home/bedroom/switch1/commands"
