The StreamLabs Water integration is used to interact with [StreamLabs water monitoring devices](https://www.streamlabswater.com/) in order to retrieve usage information and manage the away mode of the device. The [StreamLabs Water API](https://developer.streamlabswater.com) is used to retrieve daily, monthly, and yearly water usage along with the current away mode.

{% important %}
Access to the StreamLabs Water API is not free, you must have a StreamPlusâ„¢ subscription level that enables API access. Visit [https://streamlabswater.com/subscription](https://streamlabswater.com/subscription) for more information.
{% endimportant %}

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary sensor
- Sensor

In preparation for using this integration you will need to request an API key following the instructions in the [StreamLabs API Getting Started Section](https://developer.streamlabswater.com/docs/getting-started.html). Be sure to request an API key and not an OAuth token.

## Service `set_away_mode`
