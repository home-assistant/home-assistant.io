The `sky_hub` {% term integration %} offers presence detection by looking at connected devices to a [Sky Hub router](https://www.sky.com/shop/broadband-talk/sky-hub/) based router.

To use your Sky Hub device in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: sky_hub
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: false
  default: 192.168.1.254
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

See the [device tracker integration page](/integrations/device_tracker/) for instructions how to configure the people to be tracked.
