This {% term integration %} provides support for Internet Radios based on the [Frontier Silicon chipset]. Some of the manufacturers which offer products based on these chips include: Hama, Medion, Slivercrest, Auna, Technisat, Revo, Pinnel, etc. These devices will be usually controlled by the OKTIV or UNDOK apps.

## Supported models

Frontier Silicon is used by many different brands of radio manufacturers.

Supported devices include, but are not limited to:

- Hama: [IR50], [IR110], [DIR3110]
- Medion: [Medion Radios]
- Silvercrest: [SIRD 14 C2 (archived website)]
- Teufel: [Radio 3sixty (2019)]
- Roberts: [Roberts Stream 94i]
- TechniSat: [DIGITRADIO 10 IR], and some other models
- Some models from: Auna, Revo, Pinell, Como Audio

This {% term integration %} was developed and tested with a [Roberts Stream 94i].

If your device is supported by the OKTIV or UNDOK apps, then it is also supported by this integration.

## Prerequisites

The {% term integration %} supports automatic discovery of your Internet Radio. If you need to set up the device manually, please provide the device IP-address. Some models use a separate port (2244) for API access, this can be verified by visiting `http://[host]:[port]/device`.

The default PIN for Frontier Silicon-based devices is 1234. You can set the PIN code of your device (depending on manufacturer) under:
*MENU button > Main Menu > System setting > Network > NetRemote PIN setup*

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

In case your device (friendly name) is called *badezimmer*, an example automation can look something like this:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml automation
alias: "Bathroom Motion Detected"
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_sensor_166d0001171111
  from: "off"
  to: "on"
action:
  service: media_player.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id: "media_player.badezimmer"
```

## Notes and Limitations

<div class='note warning'>

Some older devices may require setting up a session to process requests. This is automatically detected by the underlying library. There is always a single user (session) controlling a device, which means that once Home Assistant connects to a device all other sessions will be invalidated.

This renders the usage of [UNDOK] almost impossible for these older devices, as the Home Assistant integration polls the device state every 30 seconds or issues a command by creating a new session. In that case, you have to disable the integration if you want to use UNDOK.
