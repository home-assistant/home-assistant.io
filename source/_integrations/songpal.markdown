The `songpal` platform allows you to control Sony's Songpal ("[Audio Control API](https://developer.sony.com/develop/audio-control-api/)") compatible devices such as soundbars, AV receivers and wireless speakers from Home Assistant.

Even when the API officially supports only a few devices (HT-ST5000, HT-MT500, HT-CT800, SRS-ZR5 and STR-DN1080), it has also been confirmed to work on others. [The list of supported devices](https://vssupport.sony.net/en_ww/device.html) from Sony's Songpal website lists devices which are likely to be compatible with this platform.

If the platform works with your non-listed device, or you encounter bugs, please feel free to [report them upstream](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-songpal).

A few notes:

- The quick start-up mode has to be enabled in order to turn the device on.
- Supports currently only one output terminal, i.e., the volume control works only on the first volume controller as reported by the backend library.
- Some devices, e.g., HT-XT3, do not support decreasing the volume step-by-step correctly.
- Feel free to improve the available services!

See [python-songpal's documentation](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-songpal#locating-the-endpoint) how to get your API endpoint.
