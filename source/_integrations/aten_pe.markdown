The `aten_pe` {% term integration %} lets you control [ATEN Rack PDUs](https://www.aten.com/eu/en/products/energy-intelligence-pduupsracks/rack-pdu/) from Home Assistant.

In order to use it, SNMP must be enabled on your PDU. It is recommended to use SNMPv3 to protect your credentials from eavesdropping.

Tested devices:

- [PE8324G](https://www.aten.com/eu/en/products/energy-intelligence-pduupsracks/rack-pdu/pe8324/)

To set it up, add the following information to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %} file:
