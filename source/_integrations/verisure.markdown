## Alarm control panel

The Verisure alarm control panel platform allows you to control your [Verisure](https://www.verisure.com/) Alarms.

The requirement is that you have setup your Verisure hub first, with the instruction above.

The `changed_by` attribute enables one to be able to take different actions depending on who armed/disarmed the alarm in [automation](/getting-started/automation/).

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Alarm status changed"
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: alarm_control_panel.alarm_1
    actions:
      - action: notify.notify
        data:
          message: >
            Alarm changed from {{ trigger.from_state.state }}
            to {{ trigger.to_state.state }}
            by {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.changed_by }}
```

{% endraw %}
