[Zigbee Home Automation](http://www.zigbee.org/zigbee-for-developers/applicationstandards/zigbeehomeautomation/)
integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect many off-the-shelf Zigbee based devices to Home Assistant, using one of the available Zigbee radio modules compatible with [zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy) (an open source Python library implementing a Zigbee stack, which in turn relies on separate libraries which can each interface a with Zigbee radio module a different manufacturer).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Sensor
- Light
- Lock
- Switch
- Fan

## ZHA exception and deviation handling

Zigbee devices that deviate from or do not fully conform to the standard specifications set by the [Zigbee Alliance](https://www.zigbee.org) may require the development of custom [ZHA Device Handlers](https://github.com/dmulcahey/zha-device-handlers) (ZHA custom quirks handler implementation) to for all their functions to work properly with the ZHA integration in Home Assistant. These ZHA Device Handlers for Home Assistant can thus be used to parse custom messages to and from Zigbee devices.

The custom quirks implementations for zigpy implemented as ZHA Device Handlers for Home Assistant are a similar concept to that of [Hub-connected Device Handlers for the SmartThings Classics platform](https://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/device-type-developers-guide/) as well as that of [Zigbee-Shepherd Converters as used by Zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/how_tos/how_to_support_new_devices.html), meaning they are each virtual representations of a physical device that expose additional functionality that is not provided out-of-the-box by the existing integration between these platforms.

## Known working Zigbee radio modules

  - [RaspBee Raspberry Pi Shield from Dresden-Elektronik](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/raspbee/)
- ZiGate based radios (via the [zigpy-zigate](https://github.com/doudz/zigpy-zigate) library for zigpy and require firmware 3.1a or later)
  - [ZiGate USB-TTL](https://zigate.fr/produit/zigate-ttl/)
  - [ZiGate USB-DIN](https://zigate.fr/produit/zigate-usb-din/)
  - [PiZiGate](https://zigate.fr/produit/pizigate-v1-0/)
  - [Wifi ZiGate](https://zigate.fr/produit/zigate-pack-wifi-v1-3/) (work in progress)

## Configuration

To configure the component, select ZHA on the Integrations page and provide the path to your Zigbee USB stick.

Or, you can manually confiure `zha` section in `configuration.yaml`. The path to the database which will persist your network data is required.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
zha:
  usb_path: /dev/ttyUSB2
  database_path: /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/zigbee.db
```

If you are use ZiGate, you have to use some special usb_path configuration:
  - ZiGate USB TTL or DIN: `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `auto` to auto discover the zigate
  - PiZigate : `pizigate:/dev/serial0`
  - Wifi Zigate : `socket://[IP]:[PORT]` for example `socket://192.168.1.10:9999`

{% configuration %}
radio_type:
  description: One of `ezsp`, `xbee`, `deconz` or `zigate`.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: ezsp
usb_path:
  description: Path to the serial device for the radio.
  required: true
  type: string
baudrate:
  description: Baud rate of the serial device.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 57600
database_path:
  description: _Full_ path to the database which will keep persistent network data.
  required: true
  type: string
enable_quirks:
  description: Enable quirks mode for devices where manufacturers didn't follow specs.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: true
{% endconfiguration %}

To add new devices to the network, call the `permit` service on the `zha` domain. Do this by clicking the Service icon in Developer tools and typing `zha.permit` in the **Service** dropdown box. Next, follow the device instructions for adding, scanning or factory reset.

In case you want to add Philips Hue bulbs that have previously been added to another bridge, have a look at: [https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief/](https://github.com/vanviegen/hue-thief/)

## Troubleshooting

### ZHA Start up issue with Home-Assistant Docker/Hass.io installs on linux hosts

On Linux hosts ZHA can fail to start during HA startup or restarts because the zigbee USB device is being claimed by the host's modemmanager service. To fix this disable the modemmanger on the host system.

To remove modemmanager from an Debian/Ubuntu host run this command:

```bash
sudo apt-get purge modemmanager
```
