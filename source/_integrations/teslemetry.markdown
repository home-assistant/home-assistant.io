The Teslemetry integration exposes various commands and sensors from the Tesla vehicles and energy sites connected to a [Teslemetry](https://teslemetry.com/) subscription.

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Teslemetry](https://teslemetry.com) account, active subscription, and [access token](https://teslemetry.com/console).

Vehicles delivered in 2024 and later will require a [virtual key](https://teslemetry.com/docs/topics/virtualkey) to be configured in order to run certain commands.
