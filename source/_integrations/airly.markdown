The **Airly** {% term integration %} uses the [Airly](https://airly.eu/) web service as a source for air quality data for your location.

## Setup

To generate an Airly API key, go to [Airly for developers](https://developer.airly.eu/register) page.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% note %}
Airly allows 100 data updates per day. For this reason, the more Airly instances
configured, the less frequent updates will be. For one configured Airly instance,
data will be updated every 15 minutes, for two configured instances, data will
be updated every 30 minutes, for three configured instances, data will be 
updated every 45 minutes, etc.
