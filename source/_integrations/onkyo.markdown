The `onkyo` {% term integration %} allows you to control a [Onkyo](https://www.onkyo.com), [Integra](http://www.integrahometheater.com)
and some recent [Pioneer](https://www.pioneerelectronics.com) receivers from Home Assistant.
Please be aware that you need to enable "Network Standby" for this integration to work in your Hardware.

## Configuration

To add an Onkyo or Pioneer receiver to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: onkyo
    host: 192.168.1.2
    name: receiver
    sources:
      pc: "HTPC"
```

 If your receiver has second or third zoneâ€™s available, they are displayed as additional media players with the same functionality as the main zone.

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: IP address of the device. Example:`192.168.1.2`. If not specified, the platform will load any discovered receivers.
  required: false
  type: string
name:
  description: Name of the device. (*Required if host is specified*)
  required: false
  type: string
max_volume:
  description: Maximum volume as a percentage. Often the maximum volume of the receiver is far too loud. Setting this will set Home Assistant's 100% volume to be this setting on the amp. i.e., if you set this to 50% when you set Home Assistant to be 100% then your receiver will be set to 50% of its maximum volume.
  required: false
  default: 100
  type: integer
receiver_max_volume:
  description: The number of steps it takes for the receiver to go from the lowest to the highest possible volume. Possible values are 50, 80, 100, 200. For older Onkyo receivers, this typically is 80; newer Onkyo receivers use 200.
  required: false
  default: 80
  type: integer
sources:
  description: A list of mappings from source to source name. Valid sources can be found below. A default list will be used if no source mapping is specified.
  required: false
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

### Action `onkyo_select_hdmi_output`

Changes HDMI output of your receiver

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | String or list of a single `entity_id` that will change output. |
| `hdmi_output`          | no       | The desired output code.                                        |

Accepted values are:
'no', 'analog', 'yes', 'out', 'out-sub', 'sub', 'hdbaset', 'both', 'up'
which one to use seems to vary depending on model so you will have to try them out.
( For model TX-NR676E it seems to be 'out' for main, 'out-sub' for sub, and 'sub' for both )

### Example `play_media` script

The `play_media` function can be used in script to play radio station by preset number.
Not working for NET radio.

```yaml
# Example play_media script
#
script:
 radio1:
    alias: "Radio 1"
    sequence:
      - action: media_player.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
      - action: media_player.play_media
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
        data:
          media_content_type: "radio"
          media_content_id: "1"
```

### Example `onkyo_select_hdmi_output` script

```yaml
# Example onkyo_select_hdmi_output script
#
script:
 hdmi_sub:
    alias: "Hdmi out projector"
    sequence:
      - action: media_player.onkyo_select_hdmi_output
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.onkyo
          hdmi_output: out-sub
```
