The `prometheus` {% term integration %} exposes metrics in a format which [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) can read.

## Configuration

To use the `prometheus` {% term integration %} in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
prometheus:
```

{% configuration %}
namespace:
  description: The "namespace" that will be assigned to all the Prometheus metrics. This is the prefix of the metric name. E.g., having `myhass` as the namespace will cause the device tracker metrics to be `myhass_device_tracker_state`, the switch metrics to be `myhass_switch_state` and so on. The default is to not add any prefix to the metrics name. (available in version 0.73.0 and later)

### Configure Filter

By default, no entity will be excluded. To limit which entities are being exposed to `Prometheus`, you can use the `filter` parameter.

```yaml
# Example filter to include specified domains and exclude specified entities
prometheus:
  filter:
    include_domains:
      - alarm_control_panel
      - light
    include_entity_globs:
      - binary_sensor.*_occupancy
    exclude_entities:
      - light.kitchen_light
```

{% include common-tasks/filters.md %}

## Full Example

Advanced configuration example:

```yaml
# Advanced configuration.yaml entry
prometheus:
  namespace: hass
  component_config_glob:
    sensor.*_hum:
      override_metric: humidity_percent
    sensor.*_temp:
      override_metric: temperature_c
    sensor.temperature*:
      override_metric: temperature_c
    sensor.*_bat:
      override_metric: battery_percent
  filter:
    include_domains:
      - sensor
    exclude_entity_globs:
      - sensor.weather_*
```

You can then configure Prometheus to fetch metrics from Home Assistant by adding to its `scrape_configs` configuration.

```yaml
# Example Prometheus scrape_configs entry
  - job_name: "hass"
    scrape_interval: 60s
    metrics_path: /api/prometheus

    # Legacy api password
    params:
      api_password: ['PASSWORD']

    # Long-Lived Access Token
    bearer_token: "your.longlived.token"

    scheme: https
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['HOSTNAME:8123']
```

Replace `your.longlived.token` with a Home Assistant [generated token](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token).

The format to configure the bearer token has changed in Prometheus 2.26, so if you have a newer version, you can use this configuration sample:

```yaml
# Example Prometheus scrape_configs entry (For version 2.26+
  - job_name: "hass"
    scrape_interval: 60s
    metrics_path: /api/prometheus

    # Long-Lived Access Token
    authorization:
      credentials: "your.longlived.token"

    scheme: https
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['HOSTNAME:8123']
```

When looking into the metrics on the Prometheus side, there will be:

- All Home Assistant domains, which can be easily found through the common **namespace** prefix, if defined.
- The [client library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) provided metrics, which are a bunch of **process_\*** and also a single pseudo-metric **python_info** which contains (not as value but as labels) information about the Python version of the client, i.e., the Home Assistant Python interpreter.
  
Typically, you will only be interested in the first set of metrics.

## Metrics in unavailable or unknown states

When the Prometheus exporter starts (typically when Home Assistant starts), all non-excluded entities in an unavailable or unknown state are not be exported until they are available again. If the entity goes into state unavailable or unknown again, the value exported will always be the latest known one.

While an entity is in those states, the `entity_available` corresponding metric is set to 0. This metric can be used to filter out values while the entity is unavailable or in an unknown state thanks to a [recording rule](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/).

For example:

```yaml
- record: "known_temperature_c"
  expr: "temperature_c unless entity_available == 0"
```
