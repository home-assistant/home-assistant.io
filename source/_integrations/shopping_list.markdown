The **Shopping list** {% term integration %} allows you to keep track of shopping list items.

Your shopping list will be accessible from the sidebar, and you can optionally add the [To-do list card](/dashboards/todo-list/) to your dashboard. With the [conversation integration](/integrations/conversation/), you can add items to your shopping list using voice commands like "Add eggs to my shopping list."

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}
