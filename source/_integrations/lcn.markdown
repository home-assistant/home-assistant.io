The `lcn` integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect to [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) hardware devices.

The integration requires one unused license of the coupling software LCN-PCHK (version >2.8) and an LCN hardware coupler. Alternatively, an LCN-PKE coupler can be used which offers two PCHK licenses.
With this setup sending and receiving commands to and from LCN modules is possible.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Light](#light)
- [Scene](#scene)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

{% note %}
The implemented platforms do not cover the whole functionality of the LCN system.
Therefore the `lcn` integration offers a variety of [events](#events), [device triggers](#device-triggers) and [service calls](#services).
They are ideal to be used in automation scripts or for the `template` platforms.

## Configuration

To use your LCN system in your installation, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
You have to specify at least one IP/port with login credentials for a PCHK host.
Consider to store your credentials in a [`secrets.yaml`](/docs/configuration/secrets).

```yaml

## LCN addresses

LCN hardware devices connected to the LCN bus are called _modules_. LCN modules are addressed by their numeric id in the range (5..254).

Modules can be arranged in _segments_. Segments can be addressed by their numeric id (5..128) or 0 (= no segment exist) or 3 (= target all segments).

LCN Modules within the _same_ segment can be grouped by their group id (5..254) or 3 (= target all groups.)

The LCN integration allows the connection to more than one hardware coupler. In this case, it has to be specified which hardware coupler should be used for addressing the specified module.

Whenever the address of a module or a group has to be specified, it can be addressed using one of the following syntaxes:

Example for modules:

```txt
connid.s000.m007
connid.s0.m7
s0.m7
0.7
```

Example for groups:

```txt
connid.s000.g007
connid.s0.g7
s0.g7
0.g7
```

Leading zeroes in the segment id or module/group id can be omitted. If the `connection_id` is omitted, the first connection defined in the [configuration](#configuration) will be used.

## LCN constants

The platforms and service calls use several predefined constants as parameters.

### Ports

### Keys:

Whenever a key has to be provided, it is defined by a joint string consisting of the table identifier (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and the corresponding key number.
Examples: `a1`, `a5`, `d8`.

## Platforms

### Binary sensor

The `lcn` binary sensor platform allows the monitoring of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) binary data sources:

- Binary hardware sensors
- Lock state of regulator setpoints
- Lock state of keys

The binary sensor can be used in automation scripts or in conjunction with `template` platforms.

### Climate

The `lcn` climate platform allows the control of the [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) climate regulators.
This platform depends on the correct configuration of the module's regulators, which has to be done in the LCN-PRO programming software.
You need to specify at least the variable for the current temperature and a setpoint variable for the target temperature.
If the control is set lockable, the regulator can be turned on/off.

{% tip %}
If you intend to leave the regulation to Home Assistant, you should consider using the [Generic Thermostat](/integrations/generic_thermostat/) in conjunction with [LCN Sensor](#sensor) and [LCN Switch](#switch).
{% endtip %}

### Cover

The `lcn` cover platform allows the control of [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) relays and output ports which have been configured as motor controllers.

Only for the module with firmware earlier than 190C:<br>
The configuration allows the optional definition of reverse time. This is the time which is waited during the switching of the motor currents.
The reverse time should only be defined when using the [MOTOR_PORT](#ports) value `OUTPUTS`. For all other configuration, the reverse time has to be defined in the LCN Pro software.
For the reverse time, you may choose one of the following constants: `RT70` (70ms), `RT600` (600ms), `RT1200` (1,2s).

{% important %}
If you are using the module's output ports for motor control, ensure that you have configured the output ports as motor controllers in the LCN Pro software!
Otherwise, the output ports are not mutually interlocked and you run the risk of destroying the motor.
{% endimportant %}

### Light

The `lcn` light platform allows the control of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) ports:

- (Dimmable) output ports
- Relays

### Scene

The `lcn` scene platform allows the activation of previously programmed [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) scenes.

### Sensor

The `lcn` sensor platform allows the monitoring of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) data sources:

- Variables
- Regulator setpoints
- Thresholds
- S0 inputs
- LED states
- Logic operation states

The sensor can be used in automation scripts or in conjunction with `template` platforms.

{% important %}
Ensure that the LCN module is configured properly to provide the requested value.
Otherwise, the module might show unexpected behavior or return error messages.
{% endimportant %}

### Switch

The `lcn` switch platform allows the control of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) ports:

- Output ports
- Relays

## Additional features

### Transponder, fingerprint sensor and code lock

To use LCN transponders, fingerprint sensors or code locks ensure that the corresponding module's I-port property
is enabled in the LCN-PRO software and properly configured.
LCN transponders, fingerprints and code locks are identified by a six value hexadecimal code (e.g. *123abc*).
If a code is received a corresponding event ([transponder event](#event-lcn_transponder), [fingerprint event](#event-lcn_fingerprint), [codelock event](#event-lcn_codelock))
is fired and can be used to trigger an automation.
Alternatively, you can use the corresponding [device triggers](#device-triggers).

Example:

This example shows how the `event_data` can be extracted and used in a condition using Home Assistant's templating engine.
Trigger on a transponder event and ensure that the received code is in the given list:

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: lcn_transponder
  condition: "{{ trigger.event.data.code in ['aabbcc', 'ddeeff', '112233'] }}"
  action:
    ...
```

{% endraw %}

Further examples can be found in the [event section](#events).

### Remote control

To use LCN remote controls (e.g., LCN-RT or LCN-RT16) ensure that the corresponding module's I-port property
is enabled in the LCN-PRO software and its behavior is properly configured as "IR access control".
With this configuration each remote control is identified by a six value hexadecimal code (e.g. *123abc*).
If a command from a remote control is received a corresponding event ([transponder event](#event-lcn_transponder))
is fired and can be used to trigger an automation. Along with the transmitted code, the pressed key and the key action
are transmitted.
Alternatively, you can use the corresponding [device triggers](#device-triggers).

Examples can be found in the [event section](#events).

### LCN commands addressed to PCHK host (Home Assistant)

A LCN module can not only be programmed to send commands to other modules/groups but also to the PCHK host configured
in the LCN integration. These commands are directly passed to Home Assistant and can be evaluated. Only the *send keys*
(former) command is supported.

Within LCN-PRO program the *send keys* command (only "A-C former command" is supported) to a key. For the target address
manually enter the PCHK host id (default: 4). Select the keys and key actions as desired.

When a *send keys* command is received, the LCN integration will fire a [send keys event](#event-lcn_send_keys) for each
key configured. These events can be used to trigger an automation.
Alternatively, you can use the corresponding [device triggers](#device-triggers).

Examples can be found in the [event section](#events).

{% note %}
Only commands sent from physical buttons of a module are evaluated. The "Test command" button in the LCN-PRO software
is not evaluated and therefore cannot be used for testing purposes.
{% endnote %}

## Events

There are several functionalities of the LCN system which are not exposed as regular entities by the integration, but as events.
Examples are button presses from remote controls (transmitters), transponder findings, fingerprint sensors and so called *send keys* events.

{% tip %}
If you find it difficult to deal with events in scripted automations, you can also use [device triggers](#device-triggers)
which offer automation design via the UI.
{% endtip %}

All events have some common attributes in their `event_data` which identify the sending LCN hardware module (e.g., the module the transponder is connected to):

| Event payload | Description                      | Values |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ |
| `device_id`   | Internal device id of LCN module | string |
| `segment_id`  | Module's segment id              | 5..128 |
| `module_id`   | Module id                        | 5..254 |

In addition, every event has its own special attributes which are described below.
All special attributes are optional and can be used as supplementary filters.

### Event: `lcn_transmitter`

The `lcn_transmitter` event is fired if a LCN remote control command is received.

    - platform: event
      event_type: lcn_send_keys
      event_data:
        key: a1
        action: hit
```

## Device triggers

To simplify using events in automations the LCN integration exposes them as device triggers.
Those device triggers can be selected from the automation editor within Home Assistant.

After creating a new automation select *Device* as trigger type and search for the module which is
supposed to cause the event in the device list. You may select the trigger type and configure its
attributes. If an attribute is optional it is considered as a supplementary filter for the trigger.
For an explanation of the attributes refer to the corresponding [events](#events).

## Services

In order to directly interact with the LCN system, and invoke commands which are not covered by the implemented platforms, the following service calls can be used.
Refer to the [Services Calls](/docs/scripts/service-calls) page for examples on how to use them.
