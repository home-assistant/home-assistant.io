The **LCN** {% term integration %} for Home Assistant allows you to connect to [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) hardware devices.

## Prerequisites

- The integration requires one unused license of the coupling software LCN-PCHK (version >2.8) and an LCN hardware coupler. 
- Alternatively, an LCN-VISU or LCN-PKE coupler can be used which offers at least two PCHK licenses.
With this setup, sending and receiving commands to and from LCN modules is possible.

The `lcn` integration allows connections to more than one hardware coupler. For each coupler, a new integration entry needs to be created.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Supported device types

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Light](#light)
- [Scene](#scene)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

{% note %}
The implemented platforms do not cover the whole functionality of the LCN system.
Therefore the `lcn` integration offers a variety of [events](#events), [device triggers](#device-triggers) and [actions](#actions).
They are ideal to be used in automation scripts or for the `template` platforms.
{% endnote %}


## Setting up devices and entites

The `lcn` hardware modules and groups are represented by Home Assistant *devices*. The periphery of each `lcn` module is represented by Home Assistant *entities*. Peripheries are, for example, the output ports, relays, and variables of a module. Refer to the description of each [platform](#platforms) to learn about which entity should be used for which periphery.

The configuration of the `lcn` devices and entities is completely done using a web user interface (configuration panel).

Once the integration is added to Home Assistant, you can access the `lcn` configuration panel by selecting the **Configure** button next to the respective integration entry on the [LCN integration page](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=lcn).

The detailed documentation for the LCN frontend panel can be found [here](https://github.com/alengwenus/lcn-frontend/blob/main/docs/lcn-frontend.md).

## Platforms

### Binary sensor

The `lcn` binary sensor platform allows the monitoring of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) binary data sources:

- Binary hardware sensors
- Lock state of regulator setpoints
- Lock state of keys

The binary sensor can be used in automation scripts or in conjunction with `template` platforms.

### Climate

The `lcn` climate platform allows the control of the [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) climate regulators.
This platform depends on the correct configuration of the module's regulators, which has to be done in the LCN-PRO programming software.
You need to specify at least the variable for the current temperature and a setpoint variable for the target temperature.
If the control is set lockable, the regulator can be turned on/off.

{% tip %}
If you intend to leave the regulation to Home Assistant, you should consider using the [Generic Thermostat](/integrations/generic_thermostat/) in conjunction with [LCN Sensor](#sensor) and [LCN Switch](#switch).
{% endtip %}

### Cover

The `lcn` cover platform allows the control of [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) relays and output ports which have been configured as motor controllers.
Refer to the [motors table](#motors) to learn about which motor uses which module periphery.

Only for the module with firmware earlier than 190C:<br>
The configuration allows the optional definition of reverse time. This is the time which is waited during the switching of the motor currents.
The reverse time should only be defined when using the module's output ports for driving the cover. For all other configuration, the reverse time has to be defined in the LCN Pro software.
For the reverse time, you may choose one of the following constants: `RT70` (70ms), `RT600` (600ms), `RT1200` (1,2s).

{% important %}
If you are using the module's output ports for motor control, ensure that you have configured the output ports as motor controllers in the LCN Pro software!
Otherwise, the output ports are not mutually interlocked and you run the risk of destroying the motor.
{% endimportant %}

### Light

The `lcn` light platform allows the control of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) ports:

- (Dimmable) output ports
- Relays

### Scene

The `lcn` scene platform allows the activation of previously programmed [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) scenes.

### Sensor

The `lcn` sensor platform allows the monitoring of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) data sources:

- Variables
- Regulator setpoints
- Thresholds
- S0 inputs
- LED states
- Logic operation states

The sensor can be used in automation scripts or in conjunction with `template` platforms.

{% important %}
Ensure that the LCN module is configured properly to provide the requested value.
Otherwise, the module might show unexpected behavior or return error messages.
{% endimportant %}

### Switch

The `lcn` switch platform allows the control of the following [LCN](https://www.lcn.eu/) ports:

- Output ports
- Relays

## Additional features

### Transponder, fingerprint sensor and code lock

To use LCN transponders, fingerprint sensors or code locks ensure that the corresponding module's I-port property
is enabled in the LCN-PRO software and properly configured.
LCN transponders, fingerprints and code locks are identified by a six value hexadecimal code (e.g. *123abc*).
If a code is received a corresponding event ([transponder event](#event-lcn_transponder), [fingerprint event](#event-lcn_fingerprint), [codelock event](#event-lcn_codelock))
is fired and can be used to trigger an automation.
Alternatively, you can use the corresponding [device triggers](#device-triggers).

Example:

This example shows how the `event_data` can be extracted and used in a condition using Home Assistant's templating engine.
Trigger on a transponder event and ensure that the received code is in the given list:

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: lcn_transponder
  condition: "{{ trigger.event.data.code in ['aabbcc', 'ddeeff', '112233'] }}"
  action:
    ...
```

{% endraw %}

Further examples can be found in the [event section](#events).

### Remote control

To use LCN remote controls (e.g., LCN-RT or LCN-RT16) ensure that the corresponding module's I-port property
is enabled in the LCN-PRO software and its behavior is properly configured as "IR access control".
With this configuration each remote control is identified by a six value hexadecimal code (e.g. *123abc*).
If a command from a remote control is received a corresponding event ([transponder event](#event-lcn_transponder))
is fired and can be used to trigger an automation. Along with the transmitted code, the pressed key and the key action
are transmitted.
Alternatively, you can use the corresponding [device triggers](#device-triggers).

Examples can be found in the [event section](#events).

### LCN commands addressed to PCHK host (Home Assistant)

A LCN module can not only be programmed to send commands to other modules/groups but also to the PCHK host configured
in the LCN integration. These commands are directly passed to Home Assistant and can be evaluated. Only the *send keys*
(former) command is supported.

Within LCN-PRO program the *send keys* command (only "A-C former command" is supported) to a key. For the target address
manually enter the PCHK host id (default: 4). Select the keys and key actions as desired.

When a *send keys* command is received, the LCN integration will fire a [send keys event](#event-lcn_send_keys) for each
key configured. These events can be used to trigger an automation.
Alternatively, you can use the corresponding [device triggers](#device-triggers).

Examples can be found in the [event section](#events).

{% note %}
Only commands sent from physical buttons of a module are evaluated. The "Test command" button in the LCN-PRO software
is not evaluated and therefore cannot be used for testing purposes.
{% endnote %}

## Events

There are several functionalities of the LCN system which are not exposed as regular entities by the integration, but as events.
Examples are button presses from remote controls (transmitters), transponder findings, fingerprint sensors and so called *send keys* events.

{% tip %}
If you find it difficult to deal with events in scripted automations, you can also use [device triggers](#device-triggers)
which offer automation design via the UI.
{% endtip %}

All events have some common attributes in their `event_data` which identify the sending LCN hardware module (e.g., the module the transponder is connected to):

| Event payload | Description                      | Values |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ |
| `device_id`   | Internal device id of LCN module | string |
| `segment_id`  | Module's segment id              | 5..128 |
| `module_id`   | Module id                        | 5..254 |

In addition, every event has its own special attributes which are described below.
All special attributes are optional and can be used as supplementary filters.

### Event: `lcn_transmitter`

The `lcn_transmitter` event is fired if a LCN remote control command is received.

| Special payload | Description      | Values                 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `code`          | Transmitter code | string (6 hex values)  |

| `action`        | Key action       | `hit`, `make`, `break` |

Example:

The trigger will fire if any key on the remote control with code *123abc* is `hit` as long as the
receiver hardware is connected to module 7 in segment 0.

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: lcn_transmitter
      event_data:
        segment_id: 0
        module_id: 7
        code: 123abc
        action: hit
```

### Event: `lcn_transponder`

The `lcn_transponder` event is fired if a LCN transponder command is received.

| Special payload | Description      | Values                |

| `code`          | Fingerprint code | string (6 hex values) |

Example:

The trigger will fire if the fingerprint with code *123abc* was detected at
any hardware module.

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: lcn_fingerprint
      event_data:
        code: 123abc
```

### Event: `lcn_codelock`

The `lcn_codelock` event is fired if a LCN code lock command is received.

| Special payload | Description    | Values                |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| `code`          | Code lock code | string (6 hex values) |

Example:

The trigger will fire if the code lock with code *123abc* was activated at
any hardware module.

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: lcn_codelock
      event_data:
        code: 123abc
```

### Event: `lcn_send_keys`

The `lcn_send_keys` event is fired if the PCHK host receives a *send keys* command.

| Special payload | Description | Values                 |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `key`           | LCN Key     | a1..c8                 |
| `action`        | Key action  | `hit`, `make`, `break` |

Example:

The trigger will fire if the PCHK host receives a command that issues a `hit` of
key `a1`.

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: lcn_send_keys
      event_data:
        key: a1
        action: hit
```

## Device triggers

To simplify using events in automations the LCN integration exposes them as device triggers.
Those device triggers can be selected from the automation editor within Home Assistant.

After creating a new automation select *Device* as trigger type and search for the module which is
supposed to cause the event in the device list. You may select the trigger type and configure its
attributes. If an attribute is optional it is considered as a supplementary filter for the trigger.
For an explanation of the attributes refer to the corresponding [events](#events).

## Actions

In order to directly interact with the LCN system, and invoke commands which are not covered by the implemented platforms, the following actions can be used.

  address: myhome.0.7
  keys: a1a5d8
  time: 5
  time_unit: s
```

### Action: `lock_keys`

Locks keys.
If the table is not defined, it is assumed to be table `a`.
The key lock states are defined as a string with eight characters. Each character represents the state change of a key lock (1=on, 0=off, t=toggle, -=nochange).
The command allows the locking of keys for a specified time period. For a time period, the attributes `time` and `time_unit` have to be specified. For a time period, only table `a` is allowed.
If `time_unit` is not defined, it is assumed to be `seconds`.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                   | Values                            |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `address`              | No       | [LCN address](#lcn-addresses) |
| `table`                | Yes      | Table with keys to lock       |
| `state`                | No       | Key lock states as string     | [KEY_STATE](#states)              |
| `time`                 | Yes      | Time period to lock           | 0..                               |
| `time_unit`            | Yes      | Time unit                     | [TIME_UNIT](#variables-and-units) |

Examples:

Lock keys forever:
```yaml
action: lcn.lock_keys
data:
  address: myhome.0.7
  table: a
  state: 1---t0--
```

Lock keys for a specified time period:
```yaml
action: lcn.lock_keys
data:
  address: myhome.0.7
  state: 1---t0--
  time: 10
  time_unit: s
```

### Action: `dyn_text`

Send dynamic text to LCN-GTxD displays.
The displays support four rows for text messages.
Each row can be set independently and can store up to 60 characters (encoded in UTF-8).


| Data attribute | Optional | Description                        | Values |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| `address`              | No       | [LCN address](#lcn-addresses)      |
| `row`                  | No       | Text row 1..4                      |
| `text`                 | No       | Text to send for the specified row |

Example:

```yaml
action: lcn.dyn_text
data:
  address: myhome.0.7
  row: 1
  text: "text in row 1"
```

### Action: `pck`

Send arbitrary PCK command. Only the command part of the PCK command has to be specified in the `pck` string.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                   | Values |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------ |
| `address`              | No       | [LCN address](#lcn-addresses) |
| `pck`                  | No       | PCK command                   |

Example:

```yaml
action: lcn.pck
data:
  address: myhome.0.7
  pck: PIN4
```
