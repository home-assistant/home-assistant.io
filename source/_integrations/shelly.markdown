Integrate [Shelly devices](https://shelly.cloud) into Home Assistant.

## Shelly device configuration

Shelly devices use the `CoIoT` protocol to communicate with integration. For Shelly firmware 1.10.0 or newer, `CoIoT` must be enabled in the device settings. Navigate to the local IP address of your Shelly device, **Internet & Security** >> **ADVANCED - DEVELOPER SETTINGS** and check the box **Enable CoIoT**.

We recommend using `unicast` for communication. To enable this, enter the local IP address of the Home Assistant server and port `5683` into the **CoIoT peer** field and push **SAVE** button. This is mandatory for Shelly Motion with firmware 1.1.0 or newer. After changing the **CoIoT peer**, the Shelly device needs to be manually restarted.

<div class="note">
Integration is communicating directly with the device; cloud connection is not needed.

## Entity naming

The integration uses the following strategy to name its entities:

- If `Device Name` or `Channel Name` is set in the device, the integration will use them to generate the entities' name.
- If channel names are set, they will be used in the entity names. The device name will not be used.
- If only the device name is set, and the device has multiple channels, the channel number will be appended to the entity name (e.g., Channel 2).
- In case device name and channel names are not set, the entity name will be generated by the `Device Type`, `Device ID` and `Channel Number`.

Examples:

| Device Name | Channel Name   | Entity Name                     |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------------------------|
| `Not set`   |	`Not Set`	     | shellyswitch25-ABC123 Channel 1 |
| `Not set`	  | Kids Room Bulb | Kids Room Bulb                  |
| Kitchen     |	`Not Set`	     | Kitchen Channel 1               |
| Bedroom	    | Round Bulb     | Round Bulb                      |

Names are set from the device web page:

- Device name can be set in **Settings** >> **DEVICE NAME**
- Channel name for single-channel devices can be set in **Settings** >> **CHANNEL NAME**
- Channel name for multi-channel devices can be set in **Settings** >> **CHANNEL NAME** after selecting the channel, by clicking on the channel name.

## Appliance type

Shelly device relays are added to the Home Assistant by default as `switch` entities. A relay can be added as a `light` entity if the device uses firmware version 1.9.0 or newer and the **Settings** >> **APPLIANCE TYPE** value is set to `light`.

## Events

If the **BUTTON TYPE** of the switch connected to the device is set to `momentary` or `detached switch`, integration fires events under the type `shelly.click` when the switch is used. You can use these events in your automations.

Also, some devices do not add an entity for the button/switch. For example, the Shelly Button1 has only one entity for the battery level. It does not have an entity for the button itself. To trigger automations based on button presses, use the `shelly.click` event.

### Listening for events

You can subscribe to the `shelly.click` event type in [Developer Tools/Events](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/tools/dev-tools/) in order to examine the event data JSON for the correct parameters to use in your automations. For example, `shelly.click` returns event data JSON similar to the following when you press the Shelly Button1.

```yaml
Event 0 fired 9:53 AM:
{
    "event_type": "shelly.click",
    "data": {
        "device_id": "e09c64a22553484d804353ef97f6fcd6",
        "device": "shellybutton1-A4C12A45174",
        "channel": 1,
        "click_type": "single"
    },
    "origin": "LOCAL",
    "time_fired": "2021-04-28T08:53:12.755729+00:00",
    "context": {
        "id": "e0f379706563aaa0c2c1fda5174b5a0e",
        "parent_id": null,
        "user_id": null
    }
}
```

### Automation examples

```yaml
- alias: "Toggle living room light"
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: shelly.click
    event_data:
      device: shellyswitch25-AABBCC
      channel: 1
      click_type: single
  action:
    service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room

- alias: "Toggle living room lamp"
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: shelly.click
    event_data:
      device: shellyswitch25-AABBCC
      channel: 2
      click_type: long
  action:
    service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.lamp_living_room
```

### Possible values for `click_type`

| Shelly input event | Click Type    |
| ------------------ | --------------|
| `S`                | `single`      |
| `SS`	             | `double`      |
| `SSS`              | `triple`      |
| `L`	               | `long`        |
| `SL`	             | `single_long` |
| `LS`	             | `long_single` |

<div class="note">

Not all devices support all input events. You can check on [Shelly API Reference](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/) website what types of Shelly input events your device supports.

</div>

## Known issues and limitations

- Only supports firmware 1.8 and later
- Shelly 4Pro and Shelly Sense are not supported (devices based on old CoAP v1 protocol)
- Before set up, battery-powered devices must be woken up by pressing the button on the device.
