Integrate [Shelly devices](https://shelly.cloud) into Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Shelly device generations

There are two generations of devices. Both generations are supported by this integration. There are some differences in how devices should be configured and in the naming of entities and devices between generations.

## Shelly device configuration (generation 1)

Shelly devices use the `CoIoT` protocol to communicate with integration. For Shelly firmware 1.10.0 or newer, `CoIoT` must be enabled in the device settings. Navigate to the local IP address of your Shelly device, **Internet & Security** >> **ADVANCED - DEVELOPER SETTINGS** and check the box **Enable CoIoT**.

We recommend using `unicast` for communication. To enable this, enter the local IP address of the Home Assistant server and port `5683` into the **CoIoT peer** field and push **SAVE** button. This is mandatory for Shelly Motion with firmware 1.1.0 or newer. After changing the **CoIoT peer**, the Shelly device needs to be manually restarted.

<div class="note">
Integration is communicating directly with the device; cloud connection is not needed.
</div>

## Entity naming (generation 1)

The integration uses `Device Name` to name its entities if the device has only one relay or no relays at all.

The integration uses the following strategy to name its entities if the device has more than one relay:

- If `Device Name` or `Channel Name` is set in the device, the integration will use them to generate the entities' name.
- If channel names are set, they will be used in the entity names. The device name will not be used.
- If only the device name is set, and the device has multiple channels, the channel number will be appended to the entity name (e.g., Channel 2).
- In case device name and channel names are not set, the entity name will be generated by the `Device Type`, `Device ID` and `Channel Number`.

Examples:

| Device Name | Channel Name   | Entity Name                     |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Not set`   | `Not Set`      | shellyswitch25-ABC123 Channel 1 |
| `Not set`   | Kids Room Bulb | Kids Room Bulb                  |
| Kitchen     | `Not Set`      | Kitchen Channel 1               |
| Bedroom     | Round Bulb     | Round Bulb                      |

Names are set from the device web page:

- Device name can be set in **Settings** >> **DEVICE NAME**
- Channel name for single-channel devices can be set in **Settings** >> **CHANNEL NAME**
- Channel name for multi-channel devices can be set in **Settings** >> **CHANNEL NAME** after selecting the channel, by clicking on the channel name.

## Entity naming (generation 2)

The integration uses the following strategy to name its entities:

- If `Channel Name` is set in the device, the integration will use it to generate the entities' name, e.g. `Kitchen Light`
- If `Channel Name` is set to the default value, the integration will use the `Device ID` and default channel name to generate the entities' name, e.g. `ShellyPro4PM-9808D1D8B912 switch_0`.

## Binary input sensors

### Binary input sensors (generation 1)

Depending on how a device's button type is configured, the integration will create binary sensors corresponding to those inputs. binary sensors are not created when the button type is `momentary` or `momentary_on_release`, for these types you need to use events for your automations.

### Binary input sensors (generation 2)

For generation 2 hardware it's possible to select if a device's input is connected to a button or a switch. Binary sensors are created only if the input mode is set to `switch`. When the input is of type `button` you need to use events for your automations.

## Events

If the **BUTTON TYPE** of the switch connected to the device is set to `momentary` or `detached switch`, integration fires events under the type `shelly.click` when the switch is used. You can use these events in your automations.

Also, some devices do not add an entity for the button/switch. For example, the Shelly Button1 has only one entity for the battery level. It does not have an entity for the button itself. To trigger automations based on button presses, use the `shelly.click` event.

### Listening for events

You can subscribe to the `shelly.click` event type in [Developer Tools/Events](/docs/tools/dev-tools/) in order to examine the event data JSON for the correct parameters to use in your automations. For example, `shelly.click` returns event data JSON similar to the following when you press the Shelly Button1.

```json
Event 0 fired 9:53 AM:
{
    "event_type": "shelly.click",
    "data": {
        "device_id": "e09c64a22553484d804353ef97f6fcd6",
        "device": "shellybutton1-A4C12A45174",
        "channel": 1,
        "click_type": "single",
        "generation": 1
    },
    "origin": "LOCAL",
    "time_fired": "2021-04-28T08:53:12.755729+00:00",
    "context": {
        "id": "e0f379706563aaa0c2c1fda5174b5a0e",
        "parent_id": null,
        "user_id": null
    }
}
```

The `generation` value indicates the generation of the device that is the source of the event.

### Automations

The simplest way to create automations is to use the Home Assistant automation editor. For example, to set an automation triggered by a double press of a particular Shelly Button1:

1. In the Triggers section of the automation, set Trigger Type to `Device`.
2. In the Device dropdown menu. find the Shelly Button1.
3. In the Trigger dropdown menu, select `Button double clicked`.
4. Set any conditions and actions to complete your automation.

You can also create automations using YAML, for example:

```yaml
- alias: "Toggle living room light"
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: shelly.click
    event_data:
      device: shellyswitch25-AABBCC
      channel: 1
      click_type: single
  action:
    service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room

- alias: "Toggle living room lamp"
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: shelly.click
    event_data:
      device: shellyswitch25-AABBCC
      channel: 2
      click_type: long
  action:
    service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.lamp_living_room
```

### Possible values for `click_type`

| Shelly input event | Click Type    |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| `S`                | `single`      |
| `SS`               | `double`      |
| `SSS`              | `triple`      |
| `L`                | `long`        |
| `SL`               | `single_long` |
| `LS`               | `long_single` |

Generation 2 devices use the values `btn_down`, `btn_up`, `single_push`, `double_push` and `long_push` as `click_type`.

<div class="note">

Not all devices support all input events. You can check on [Shelly API Reference](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/) website what types of Shelly input events your device supports.

</div>

## Appliance type (generation 1)

Shelly device relays are added to Home Assistant by default as `switch` entities. A relay can be added as a `light` entity if the device uses firmware version 1.9.0 or newer and the **Settings** >> **APPLIANCE TYPE** value is set to `light`.

## Consumption type (generation 2)

Shelly device relays are added to Home Assistant by default as `switch` entities. A relay can be added as a `light` entity if **CONSUMPTION TYPE** value is set to `Lights`.

## Light transition

Shelly lights supporting light transition:

- Shelly Bulb RGBW
- Shelly DUO
- Shelly Dimmer
- Shelly Dimmer 2
- Shelly RGBW2
- Shelly Vintage

<div class="note">

Firmware 1.11 or later is required.

</div>

<div class="note">

The firmware limits the transition time to 5 seconds.

</div>

## Device services

The integration offers device services which can be triggered by a configuration button.

### OTA update

Trigger device OTA firmware update.

#### Buttons

- OTA Update
  - triggers the OTA update process for latest stable version
- OTA Update Beta (_disabled by default_)
  - triggers the OTA update process for latest beta version

### Reboot

Trigger reboot of device.

#### Buttons

- Reboot
  - triggers the reboot

## Shelly Thermostatic Radiator Valve (TRV)

Shelly TRV generates 2 entities that can be used to control the device behavior: `climate` and `number`.
The first will allow specifying a temperature, the second instead of a percentage of the valve position.

**Note**: that if you change the valve position then automatic temperature control
 will be disabled.
As soon as you change the temperature, it gets enabled again.

## CoAP port (generation 1)

In some cases, it may be needed to customize the CoAP port (default: `5683`) your Home Assistant instance is listening to.

In order to change it, add the following key to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
shelly:
  coap_port: 12345
```

## Additional info

Shelly devices rely on [SNTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#SNTP) for features like power measurement.
Please check from the device Web UI that the configured server is reachable.

## Known issues and limitations

- Only supports firmware 1.8 and later for generation 1 devices
- Only supports firmware 0.8 and later for generation 2 devices
- Generation 1 "Shelly 4Pro" and "Shelly Sense" are not supported (devices based on old CoAP v1 protocol)
- Before set up, battery-powered devices must be woken up by pressing the button on the device.
- OTA update service does not support battery-powered devices
