Integrates Dormakaba dKey Bluetooth Low Energy connected locks into Home Assistant.

The integration only supports connecting to the lock directly via Bluetooth. Connecting via the Dormakaba dKey gateway is not supported.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

In addition to a lock entity, each added dKey lock will also have:
- A battery sensor
- A binary_sensor which shows if the door is open or not
- A binary_sensor which shows the position of the lock's dead bolt

<div class='note warning'>

The Dormakaba dKey lock is currently not working with USB dongles or built-in Bluetooth radios, only [ESPHome Bluetooth proxies](/integrations/bluetooth/#remote-adapters-bluetooth-proxies) configured to allow active connections work reliably.
