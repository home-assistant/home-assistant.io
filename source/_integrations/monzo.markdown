The **Monzo** {% term integration %} allows you to connect your Monzo bank accounts to Home Assistant.


## Prerequisites and approval

1. Before adding the Monzo integration, you'll need to create a [Monzo developer account](https://developers.monzo.com/). 
2. From here, you need to create a new OAuth client for Home Assistant to use by going to **Clients** > **New OAuth Client**. 
3. Then, fill in the form as follows, making sure to **copy the URL shown** - don't replace it with your own URL:
   - Name: Home Assistant
   - Logo URL: This can be left blank
   - Redirect URLs: <https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth>
   - Description: For example: Used by the Monzo Home Assistant Integration
   - Confidentiality: Confidential

4. Once submitted, you can proceed with adding the integration.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & services**" %}, and add the **Monzo** integration.
   - Fill in the OAuth details for the client you've created in the Monzo developer portal.
   - **Important** - After authorizing Home Assistant access via email, for security you'll also need to verify again from within the Monzo app. 
     - A reminder to do this will be displayed in Home Assistant before completing the installation - don't proceed until you've done this from the popup in the mobile app.
     - If you've forgotten to do this, the integration will fail to load, but you can simply accept the popup and reload the integration without entering your details again.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

### Adding a second account

1. To add a second Monzo account in Home Assistant, repeat the above process for creating an OAuth client.
2. Then, in Home Assistant, add the new credentials *before* trying to add the new entry. 
   - In the top right of **Devices & services** page, select the three dot menu, open **Application Credentials**, and select **Add application credentials**
   - It is recommended to include the person's name in the *Name* field so you can distinguish it later. 
3. Once added, you can return to **Devices & services** > **Monzo** > **Add Entry** to proceed with authentication.

## Sensor

The integration will create a device for each of your accounts and pots. For an account or a pot, you'll have:

- Balance: The current balance of the account.

Additionally, an account will also have:

- Total Balance: The current balance of that account plus all of its pots.
