The `saj` sensor will poll a [SAJ](https://www.saj-electric.com/) solar inverter and present the values as sensors in Home Assistant.

This sensor uses the web interface and to use it, you have to be able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser.

There is a difference between inverters that are connected via an ethernet module and those connected via a WiFi module.
The WiFi module requires a username and password for authentication where the ethernet module does not.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: saj
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "The IP address of the SAJ Solar Inverter."
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: "The name of your SAJ Solar Inverter. (Optional but required when adding multiple inverters for unique sensors.)"
  required: false
  type: string
type:
  description: "Type of connection module: 'ethernet' or 'wifi'"
  required: false
  default: ethernet
  type: string
username:
  description: "Username for logging in to SAJ Solar Inverter (only used when type is 'wifi' but can be skipped if the inverter still has the default credentials set: admin/admin)"
  required: false
  type: string
password:
  description: "Password for logging in to SAJ Solar Inverter (only used when type is 'wifi' but can be skipped if the inverter still has the default credentials set: admin/admin)"
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

| temperature        | °C   | Temperature of the inverter.                                                 |
| state              | N/A  | Live state of the inverter.                                                  |

## Multiple inverters

When adding multiple inverters you need to specify a name that will be part of the sensor entity id.
If you do not specify names when adding multiple inverters you are probably see an error like this:
```
Error doing job: Task exception was never retrieved
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/frederic/home-assistant/homeassistant/helpers/entity_platform.py", line 399, in _async_add_entity
    raise HomeAssistantError(msg)
homeassistant.exceptions.HomeAssistantError: Entity id already exists: sensor.saj_current_power. Platform saj does not generate unique IDs
```

Below an example configuration for multiple inverters:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: saj
    name: MY_FIRST_INVERTER
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
  - platform: saj
    name: MY_SECOND_INVERTER
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
```

## Full configuration example for WiFi inverters

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: saj
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
    type: wifi
    username: USERNAME
    password: PASSWORD
```
