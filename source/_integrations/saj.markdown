The `saj` sensor will poll a [SAJ](https://www.saj-electric.com/) solar inverter and present the values as sensors in Home Assistant.

This sensor uses the web interface and to use it, you have to be able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser.

There is a difference between inverters that are connected via an ethernet module and those connected via a Wi-Fi module.
The Wi-Fi module requires a username and password for authentication where the ethernet module does not.

## Configuration

1. In the **Configuration** > **Integrations** menu, click the `+ ADD INTEGRATION` button on the lower-right of the screen.
2. Select **SAJ Solar Inverter** from the pop-up menu.
3. Complete the dialog box and click `SUBMIT`. 

Note: You should set up fixed/static IP address for the inverter.
