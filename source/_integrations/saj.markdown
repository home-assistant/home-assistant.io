The `saj` {% term integration %} will poll a [SAJ](https://www.saj-electric.com/) solar inverter and present the values as sensors in Home Assistant.

This sensor uses the web interface and to use it, you have to be able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser.

There is a difference between inverters that are connected via an ethernet module and those connected via a Wi-Fi module.
The Wi-Fi module requires a username and password for authentication where the ethernet module does not.

## Configuration

To enable this {% term integration %}, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: saj
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
```

{% configuration %}
