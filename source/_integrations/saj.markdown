The `saj` sensor will poll a [SAJ](https://www.saj-electric.com/) solar inverter and present the values as sensors in Home Assistant.

This sensor uses the web interface and to use it, you have to be able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser.

There is a difference between inverters that are connected via an ethernet module and those connected via a Wi-Fi module.
The Wi-Fi module requires a username and password for authentication where the ethernet module does not.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: saj
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: "The IP address of the SAJ Solar Inverter."
  required: true
  type: string
name:
  description: "An optional name for your SAJ Solar Inverter."
  required: false
  type: string
type:
  description: "Type of connection module: 'ethernet' or 'wifi'"
  required: false
  default: ethernet
  type: string
username:
  description: "Username for logging in to SAJ Solar Inverter (only used when type is 'wifi' but can be skipped if the inverter still has the default credentials set: admin/admin)"
  required: false
  type: string
password:
  description: "Password for logging in to SAJ Solar Inverter (only used when type is 'wifi' but can be skipped if the inverter still has the default credentials set: admin/admin)"
  required: false
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
