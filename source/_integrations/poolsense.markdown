[PoolSense](https://www.proautomation.co/) is a smart pool monitor that publishes data to the cloud via SigFox. PoolSense eliminates the time and effort spent fixing whatâ€™s wrong with your pool water. Accurate sensors, in the PoolSense smart pool monitor, send data to a cloud server in timed intervals. 

There is currently support for the following information within Home Assistant:

- Chlorine Level
- pH
- Water Temperature
- Battery
- pH Status Indicator
- Chlorine Status Indicator

## Prerequisites

You will need to use the associated standalone app for this device to register a username and password.

- [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poolsense/id1288535609)

## Tips

It is recommended that you create your own card with the following sensors:

- `sensor.poolsense_chlorine`
- `sensor.poolsense_ph`
- `sensor.poolsense_battery`
- `sensor.poolsense_temperature`
- `sensor.poolsense_last_seen`

Leave `sensor.poolsense_ph_status` and `sensor.poolsense_chlorine_status` as badges.
