The `mqtt` Update platform allows you to integrate devices that might expose firmware/software installed and the latest versions through MQTT into Home Assistant as an Update entity. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the entity will be updated in Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To enable MQTT Update in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - update:
      state_topic: topic-installed
      latest_version_topic: topic-latest
```

Make sure that your topic matches exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

## Examples

This is an example of Update entity configuration for Shelly Gen1 device.

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - update:
      name: "Shelly Plug S Firmware Update"
      title: "Shelly Plug S Firmware"
      release_url: "https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen1/#changelog"
      entity_picture: "https://brands.home-assistant.io/_/shelly/icon.png"
      state_topic: "shellies/shellyplug-s-112233/info"
      value_template: "{{ value_json['update'].old_version }}"
      latest_version_topic: "shellies/shellyplug-s-112233/info"
      latest_version_template: "{% if value_json['update'].new_version %}{{ value_json['update'].new_version }}{% else %}{{ value_json['update'].old_version }}{% endif %}"
      device_class: "firmware"
      command_topic: "shellies/shellyplug-s-112233/command"
      payload_install: "update_fw"
```

{% endraw %}

JSON can also be used as `state_topic` payload.

{% raw %}

```json
{
  "installed_version": "1.21.0",
  "latest_version": "1.22.0",
  "title": "Device Firmware",
  "release_url": "https://example.com/release",
  "release_summary": "A new version of our amazing firmware",
  "entity_picture": "https://example.com/icon.png"
}
```

{% endraw %}

For the above JSON payload, the `update` entity configuration should look like this:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - update:
      name: "Amazing Device Update"
      title: "Device Firmware"
      state_topic: "amazing-device/state-topic"
      device_class: "firmware"
      command_topic: "amazing-device/command"
      payload_install: "install"
```

{% endraw %}

If the device/service sends data as JSON but the schema differs, `value_template` can be use to reformat the JSON.

{% raw %}

```json
{
  "installed_ver": "2022.11",
  "new_ver": "2022.12"
}
```

{% endraw %}

For the above JSON payload, the `update` entity configuration should look like this:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
   update:
      name: "Amazing Device Update"
      title: "Device Firmware"
      state_topic: "amazing-device/state-topic"
      value_template: "{{ {'installed_version': value_json.installed_ver, 'latest_version': value_json.new_ver } | to_json }}"
      device_class: "firmware"
      command_topic: "amazing-device/command"
      payload_install: "install"
```

{% endraw %}
