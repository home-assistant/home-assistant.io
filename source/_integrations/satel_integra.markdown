The `satel_integra` integration will allow Home Assistant users who own a Satel Integra alarm panel to leverage their alarm system and its sensors to provide Home Assistant with information about their homes. Connectivity between Home Assistant and the alarm is accomplished through a ETHM extension module that must be installed in the alarm. Compatible with ETHM-1 Plus module with firmware version > 2.00 (version 2.04 confirmed).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor: Reports on zone or output statuses
- Switch: allows for setting states of selected outputs 
- Alarm Control Panel: represents the zones (in Polish: "strefa"). Reports its status, and can be used to arm/disarm the partition

The module communicates via Satel's open TCP protocol published on their website. It subscribes for new events coming from alarm system and reacts to them immediately.

## Setup

Please note that **ETHM-1 module is currently not supported**: it does not provide functionality used by this extension. At the moment only ETHM-1 Plus module is supported. That might change in the future, but no promises are given.

The library currently doesn't support encrypted connection to your alarm, so you need **to turn off encryption for integration protocol**. In Polish: "koduj integracje" must be unchecked. You will find this setting in your DloadX program.

A list of all partition, zone and output IDs can be acquired by running DloadX program and connecting to your alarm.

For the Binary Sensor check the [type/class](/integrations/binary_sensor/) list for a possible visualization of your zones. Note: If no zones or outputs are specified, Home Assistant will not load any binary_sensor components."

## Configuration

A `satel_integra` section must be present in the `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
satel_integra:
  host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The IP address of the Satel Integra ETHM module on your home network, if using socket type.
  required: true
  default: localhost
  type: string
port:
  description: The port on which the ETHM module listens for clients using integration protocol.
  required: false
  default: 7094
  type: integer
code:
  description: User password, it's needed for making use of the switchable_outputs. It's recommended not to use admin password.
  required: false
  type: string
partitions:
  description: List of the partitions to operate on.
  required: false
  type: [integer, list]
  keys:
    name:
      description: Name of the partition.
      required: true
      type: string    
    arm_home_mode:
      description: The mode in which the partition is armed when 'arm home' is used. Possible options are `1`,`2` or `3`. For more information on what the differences are between them, please refer to Satel Integra manual.
      required: false
      default: 1
      type: integer
zones:
  description: "This parameter lists the zones (or inputs) that will be visible by Home Assistant. For each zone, a proper ID must be given as well as its name. The name is arbitrary and does not need to match the one specified in Satel Integra alarm configuration."
  required: false
  type: [integer, list]
  keys:
    name:
      description: Name of the zone.
      required: true
      type: string
    type:
      description: The zone type.
      required: false
      default: motion
      type: string
outputs:
  description: "Very similar to zones, but with outputs. Satel Integra uses outputs to inform external systems about different events. For example power failure, or that alarm started counting for exit or some other user-defined condition. They may be used for simple alarm-based automation. For more information please refer to Satel homepage and forums."
  required: false
  type: [integer, list]
  keys:
    name:
      description: Name of the output.
      required: true
      type: string
    type:
      description: The type of the device - just for presentation.
      required: false
      default: motion
      type: string
switchable_outputs:
  description: "Switchable outputs. These will show up as switches within Home Assistant."
  required: false
  type: [integer, list]
  keys:

      required: true
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Full examples

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
satel_integra:
  host: 192.168.1.100
  port: 7094
  partitions:
    01:
      name: "House"
      arm_home_mode: 2
    02:
      name: "Garage"
  zones:
    01:
      name: "Bedroom"
      type: "motion"
    02:
      name: "Hall"
      type: "motion"
    30:
      name: "Kitchen - smoke"
      type: "smoke"
    113:
      name: "Entry door"
      type: "opening"
  outputs:
    05:
      name: "Garden lights trigger"
      type: "light"
    09:
      name: "Gate opening trigger"
      type: "opening"
    30:
      name: "Alarm triggered"
      type: "safety"
    32:
      name: "Alarm power problem"
      type: "safety"
  switchable_outputs:
    05:
      name: "Gate open"
    06:
      name: "Gate close"    
    14:
      name: "Garden light"
      
```

Having configured the zones and the outputs, you can use them for automation, such as to react on the movement in your bedroom.
For example:

```yaml
  alias: "Flick the input switch when movement in bedroom detected"
  trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "binary_sensor.bedroom"
      to: "on"
  action:
      service: input_boolean.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: input_boolean.movement_detected
```
