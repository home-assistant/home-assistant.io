The `satel_integra` {% term integration %} will allow Home Assistant users who own a Satel Integra alarm panel to leverage their alarm system and its sensors to provide Home Assistant with information about their homes. Connectivity between Home Assistant and the alarm is accomplished through a ETHM extension module that must be installed in the alarm. Compatible with ETHM-1 Plus module with firmware version > 2.00 (version 2.04 confirmed).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary sensor: Reports on zone or output statuses
- Switch: allows for setting states of selected outputs 
- Alarm control panel: represents the zones (in Polish: "strefa"). Reports its status, and can be used to arm/disarm the partition

The module communicates via Satel's open TCP protocol published on their website. It subscribes for new events coming from alarm system and reacts to them immediately.

## Setup

Please note that **ETHM-1 module is currently not supported**: it does not provide functionality used by this extension. At the moment only ETHM-1 Plus module is supported. That might change in the future, but no promises are given.

The library currently doesn't support encrypted connection to your alarm, so you need **to turn off encryption for integration protocol**. In Polish: "koduj integracje" must be unchecked. You will find this setting in your DloadX program.

A list of all partition, zone and output IDs can be acquired by running DloadX program and connecting to your alarm.

For the binary sensor, check the [type/class](/integrations/binary_sensor/) list for a possible visualization of your zones. Note: If no zones or outputs are specified, Home Assistant will not load any binary_sensor integrations."

## Configuration

A `satel_integra` section must be present in the {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

## Full examples

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
satel_integra:
  host: 192.168.1.100
  port: 7094
  partitions:
    01:
      name: "House"
      arm_home_mode: 2
    02:
      name: "Garage"
  zones:
    01:
      name: "Bedroom"
      type: "motion"
    02:
      name: "Hall"
      type: "motion"

      name: "Kitchen - smoke"
      type: "smoke"

      type: "opening"
  outputs:
    05:
      name: "Garden lights trigger"
      type: "light"
    09:
      name: "Gate opening trigger"
      type: "opening"
    30:
      name: "Alarm triggered"
      type: "safety"
    32:
      name: "Alarm power problem"
      type: "safety"
  switchable_outputs:
    05:
      name: "Gate open"
    06:
      name: "Gate close"    
    14:
      name: "Garden light"
      
```

Having configured the zones and the outputs, you can use them for automation, such as to react on the movement in your bedroom.
For example:

```yaml
  alias: "Flick the input switch when movement in bedroom detected"
  trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "binary_sensor.bedroom"
      to: "on"
  action:
      service: input_boolean.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: input_boolean.movement_detected
```
