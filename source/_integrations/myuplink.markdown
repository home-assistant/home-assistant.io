The myUplink integration lets you get information about the devices supporting myUplink using the [official cloud API](https://dev.myuplink.com).

Depending on the type of devices in your system, one or more entities are added to Home Assistant. Currently, there is support for reading sensor states. There is also support for switches and number entities if suitable data points are discovered in the system. Note that you may need a valid subscription with MyUplink to control your equipment with switches and number entities.

## Prerequisites

1. Visit [https://myuplink.com/register](https://myuplink.com/register) and sign up for a user account.
2. Go to [**Applications**](https://dev.myuplink.com/apps), and register a new App:

- **Application ID**: Home Assistant (or whatever name makes sense to you)
- **OAuth Flow**: Authorization Code Grant Flow
- **Redirect URI**: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`

{% details "I have manually disabled My Home Assistant" %}

If you don't have [My Home Assistant](/integrations/my) on your installation,
you can use `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>/auth/external/callback` as the redirect URI
instead.

The `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>` must be the same as used during the configuration/
authentication process.

Internal examples: `http://192.168.0.2:8123/auth/external/callback`, `http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/external/callback`."

{% enddetails %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The integration configuration will require the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created above. See [Application Credentials](/integrations/application_credentials) for more details.
