The **Envisalink** {% term integration %} will allow Home Assistant users who own either a DSC or Honeywell alarm panel to leverage their alarm system and its sensors to provide Home Assistant with rich information about their homes. Connectivity between Home Assistant and the alarm panel is accomplished through a device produced by Eyez On, known as the Envisalink. The Envisalink evl3 and evl4 boards provide a TCP/IP interface to the alarm panel, where it emulates an alarm keypad. This board also exposes a raw TCP/IP based API, upon which this integration is built. Currently, the Envisalink version 4 is the latest model. This integration supports both the evl3 and the evl4.

Please visit the [eyezon website](https://www.eyezon.com/) for further information about the evl3 and evl4 boards.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary sensor: Reports on zone status (Check the [type/class](/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class) list for a possible visualization of your zone.)
- Sensor: Emulates an alphanumeric keypad attached to the alarm panel
- Alarm control panel: Reports on partition status, and can be used to arm/disarm the system

This is a fully event-based integration. Any event sent by the Envisalink device will be immediately reflected within Home Assistant.

As of 0.29, the alarm_trigger service is supported.  It is possible to fire off an envisalink-based alarm directly from Home Assistant. For example, a newer Z-Wave/Zigbee sensor can now be integrated into a legacy alarm system using a Home Assistant automation.

An `envisalink` section must be present in the `configuration.yaml` file and contain the following options as required:

```yaml

Zone numbers correspond to the zone numbers configured on your alarm system and must be in the range of 1 to 64. For each zone, at least a name must be given. For more information about the visual representation of a zone, take a look at the [binary sensor](/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class) documentation. *Note: If no zones are specified, Home Assistant will not load any binary_sensor integrations.*"

## Services

The following services are supported by Envisalink and can be used to script or automate the alarm.

- **alarm_disarm**: Disarms the alarm with the user code provided, or the code specified in the configuration.
- **alarm_arm_home**: Arms the alarm in home mode.
- **alarm_arm_away**: Arms the alarm in standard away mode.
- **alarm_arm_night**: Arms the alarm in night mode.
- **alarm_trigger**: Trigger an alarm on the Envisalink connected alarm system. For example, a newer Z-Wave / Zigbee sensor can now be integrated into a legacy alarm system using a Home Assistant automation.
- **alarm_keypress**: Sends a string of up to 6 characters to the alarm. *Works with DSC panels, and confirmed to work with Honeywell Vista-20P (aka First Alert FA-168)*
- **invoke_custom_function**: Invokes a custom PGM function. *DSC alarms only*

## Attributes

The zone status binary sensors have extra attributes representing additional
information about each zone.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `last_tripped_time` | Last time this zone was tripped.
| `zone` | Zone number. Can be used in combination with `alarm_keypress` service
to issue commands relating to this zone.
