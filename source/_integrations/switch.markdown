Keeps track which switches are in your environment, their state and allows you to control them.

- Maintains a state per switch and a combined state `all_switches`.
- Registers services `switch.turn_on`, `switch.turn_off`, and `switch.toggle` to control switches.

## Device class

The way these switches are displayed in the frontend can be modified in the [customize section](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/). The following device classes are supported for switches:

- **None**: Generic switch. This is the default and doesn't need to be set.
- **outlet**: This switch, switches a power outlet.
- **switch**: A generic switch.

## Use the services

In the frontend open the sidebar. At the bottom, under **Developer Tools**, click **Services**. From the Service dropdown menu choose `switch.turn_on` or `switch.turn_off` from the list of available services. In the Entity dropdown menu choose or enter the entity ID you want to work with. This will enter something like the sample below into the **Service Data** field. Now hit **CALL SERVICE**.

```json
{"entity_id":"switch.livingroom_pin2"}
```

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id`            |      no  | String or list of strings that point at `entity_id`s of switches. To target all switches, set `entity_id` to `all`.
