The Spotify media player integration lets you control your Spotify
account playback and browse the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) media
library from Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

- An active Spotify account. A premium account is not required, but recommended.
  Premium accounts can be controlled (pause, play, next, etc.), while
  free accounts can only be used for browsing and current playback status.
- Spotify compatible playback [source](#selecting-output-source) device
- A Spotify Developer application. Instructions for that are in
  the next step.
 
### Create a Spotify application

For Home Assistant to communicate with Spotify, we need to create
an application at Spotify using the Spotify Developer website. This will
provide you with the Spotify application credentials Home Assistant needs
to allow you to log in with your Spotify account.

1. If Spotify was previously integrated with your Home Assistant with _outdated_ credentials,
   it might be required to remove these old Spotify account credentials using the
   {% my application_credentials title="Home Assistant Application Credentials dashboard" %}.

2. Log in to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).

3. Select the [**Create app**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create) button in the top right.

4. Enter a name and description; feel free to use any name and description you like.

   Set the _"Redirect URI"_ to the following:
   
   `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`

   Please copy and paste the exact URL above. You **do not** have to change it.

5. Select Web API.

6. Check the box to agree with the requirements and click the **Save** button
   to confirm the application creation.

7. Spotify will now show the new application you have just created. Select
   the **Settings** button in the top right to configure it.

8. Before we can start configuring Home Assistant, we need to grab the application
   credentials Home Assistant needs.

  Select on the **View client secret** button to reveal the client secret.

9. The _"Client ID"_ and _"Client secret"_ are the two pieces of information
   that Home Assistant needs to communicate with Spotify and is what we
   call: Application credentials.

  ![Get the application credentials from the Spotify Application](/images/integrations/spotify/application-credentials.png)

   You will need the _"Client ID"_ and _"Client secret"_ during the Spotify
   integration setup process in Home Assistant.

You can now continue with the next chapter to configure the Spotify integration
in Home Assistant.

{% details "I have manually disabled My Home Assistant" %}

If you don't have [My Home Assistant](/integrations/my) on your installation,
you can use `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>/auth/external/callback` as the redirect URI
instead.

The `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>` must be the same as used during the configuration/
authentication process.

Internal examples: `http://192.168.0.2:8123/auth/external/callback`, `http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/external/callback`."

{% enddetails %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Using multiple Spotify accounts

This integration supports multiple Spotify accounts at once. You don't need to
create another Spotify application in the Spotify Developer Portal.
Multiple Spotify accounts can be linked to a _single_ Spotify application.

You will have to add those accounts into the **User Management** section of
your application in the Spotify Developer Portal.

To add an additional Spotify account to Home Assistant, go to the Spotify
website, log out, and then repeat _only_ the steps in the
[Configuration](#configuration) section. 

## Selecting output source

To play media Spotify first needs a device selected for audio output known as the `source`.

```yaml
# Example code to select an AV receiver as the output device
action: media_player.select_source
target:
  entity_id: media_player.spotify
data:
  source: "Denon AVR-X2000"
```

The Spotify API cannot initiate playback to a device not already known to the Spotify API. The source list of available devices can be found in the Details section of the Spotify Media Player Control and the `source_list` attribute in the {% my developer_states title="Developer Tools States" %}.

## Playing Spotify playlists

You can send playlists to Spotify using the `"media_content_type": "playlist"`, which is part of the
[media_player.play_media](/integrations/media_player/#action-media_playerplay_media) action, for example:

```yaml
# Example script to play playlist
script:
  play_jazz_guitar:
    sequence:
      - action: media_player.play_media
        target:
          entity_id: media_player.spotify
        data:
          media_content_id: "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5xddIVAtLrZKtt4YGLM1SQ?si=YcvRqaKNTxOi043Qn4LYkg"
          media_content_type: playlist
```

The `media_content_id` value can be obtained from the Spotify desktop app by clicking on the more options ("...") next to the album art picture, selecting "Share" and then "Copy Spotify URI" or "Copy Playlist Link" (also available in the Spotify phone and web app). Alternatively a Spotify URI string (e.g. `spotify:playlist:5xddIVAtLrZKtt4YGLM1SQ`) can be supplied for the `media_content_id`.

## Unsupported devices

- **Sonos**: Although Sonos is a Spotify Connect device, it is not supported by the official Spotify API.
