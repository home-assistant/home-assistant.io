- On all supported systems, devices are detected during startup.
- On Linux systems that have functional `udev` support, including Home Assistant Operating System, devices are detected as soon as they are plugged in.
- On non-Linux systems or systems without `udev` support, devices are detected when visiting the integrations page and during onboarding.
