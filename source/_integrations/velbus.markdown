The **Velbus** {% term integration %} is used to control [Velbus](https://www.velbus.eu/?lang=en) modules. It supports the Velbus USB, Velbus serial and a TCP/IP gateway.

The pushbutton LEDs of input modules are disabled by default. These can be enabled from the `Devices` panel in the `Configuration` page of the web interface.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The port string used in the user interface or the configuration file can have 2 formats:

- For a serial device: `/dev/ttyUSB00`
- For a TCP/IP device: `127.0.0.1:3678`
- For the VMBSIG module: `tls://192.168.1.9:27015`

## Actions

- `velbus.sync clock`: Synchronize Velbus time to local clock.
- `velbus.scan`: Scan the bus for new devices.
- `velbus.set_memo_text`: Show memo text on Velbus display modules.
- `velbus.clear_cache`: Clear the full velbuscache or the cache for one module only.

### Action `velbus.sync_clock`

You can use the `velbus.sync_clock` action to synchronize the clock of the Velbus modules to the clock of the machine running Home Assistant. This is the same as the 'sync clock' button at the VelbusLink software.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `interface`            | no       | The port used to connect to the bus (the same one as used during configuration). |

### Action `velbus.scan`

You can use the `velbus.scan` action to synchronize the modules between the bus and Home Assistant. This is the same as the 'scan' button at the VelbusLink software.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `interface`            | no       | The port used to connect to the bus (the same one as used during configuration). |


### Action `velbus.set_memo_text`

You can use the `velbus.set_memo_text` action to provide the memo text to be displayed at Velbus modules like VMBGPO(D) and VMBELO.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `interface`            | no       | The port used to connect to the bus (the same one as used during configuration). |
| `address`              | no       | The module address in decimal format, which is displayed at the device list at the integration page. |
| `memo_text`            | yes      | Text to be displayed on module. When no memo text is supplied the memo text will be cleared. |

Example:

```yaml
script:
  trash_memo:
    alias: "Trash memo text"
    sequence:
    - data:
        address: 65
        memo_text: "It's trash day"
        interface: "tls://192.168.1.9:27015"
      action: velbus.set_memo_text
```

### Action `velbus.clear_cache`

You can use the `velbus.clear_cache` action to clear the cache of one module or the full cache. Once the clear happens, the integration will start a new scan.
Use this action when you make changes to your configuration via velbuslink.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `interface`            | no       | The port used to connect to the bus (the same one used during configuration). |
| `address`              | no       | The module address in decimal format, which is displayed on the device list on the integration page, if provided the service will only clear the cache for this model, without an address, the full velbuscache will be cleared. |

## VMB7IN and the Energy dashboard

In some cases, the VMB7IN sensor does not report what the counter is counting. If the counter is related to an energy device, everything will work out of the box.
But if the VMB7IN sensor is a water or gas counter, you will need to specify this in your configuration.yaml file.

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize:
    sensor.eau_counter:
      device_class: water
```

The device_class attribute can have 2 values:
- gas: if the counter represents a gas meter
- water: if the counter represents a water meter

## Example automation

The Velbus {% term integration %} allows you to link a Velbus button (i.e., a button of a [VMBGPOD](https://www.velbus.eu/products/view/?id=416302&lang=en) module) to a controllable {% term entity %} of Home Assistant.
The actual linking can be realized by two automation rules. One rule to control the device using the push button and a second rule to update the LED state of the push button as soon as the {% term entity %} state changes.

```yaml
# Control light living from Velbus push_button_10
- id: 'Control_light_living_from_Velbus'
  alias: "Control light living using Velbus push_button_10"
  trigger:
  - entity_id: binary_sensor.push_button_10
    platform: state
    to: "on"
  condition: []
  action:
  - entity_id: light.living
    action: light.toggle

# Keep status LED push_button_10 in sync to status light living
- id: 'Update LED of push_button_10'
  alias: "Update LED state of push_button_10"
  trigger:
  - entity_id: light.living
    platform: state
    to: "on"
  - entity_id: light.living
    platform: state
    to: "off"
  condition: []
  action:
  - condition: or
    conditions:
    - condition: and
      conditions:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: light.led_push_button_10
        state: "on"
      - condition: state
        entity_id: light.living
        state: "off"
    - condition: and
      conditions:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: light.led_push_button_10
        state: "off"
      - condition: state
        entity_id: light.living
        state: "on"
  - entity_id: light.led_push_button_10
    action: light.toggle
```
