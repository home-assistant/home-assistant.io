The easyEnergy integration integrates the [easyEnergy](https://www.easyenergy.com) API platform with Home Assistant.

The integration makes it possible to retrieve the dynamic energy/gas prices
from easyEnergy in order to gain insight into the price trend of the day and
to adjust your consumption accordingly.

Companies that use the data from easyEnergy:

## Sensors

The easyEnergy integration creates a number of sensor entities for both gas
and electricity prices.

### Energy market prices

In terms of electricity you get two separate services, easyEnergy uses separate
prices for electricity that you use (buy) or return (sell). Every day around
**14:00 UTC time**, the new prices are published for the following day.

- The `current` and `next hour` electricity market price
- Average electricity price of the day
- Lowest energy price
- Highest energy price
- Time of day when the price is highest
- Time of day when the price is at its lowest
- Percentage of the current price compared to the maximum price
- Number of hours with the current price higher or lower

Entities with the number of hours indicate how many hours there are with a price
**above** or **below** the current hourly price. If we take the graph below as an example
and it is 00:30, then there are 8 hours below the current price and 4 hours above the
current price. With this information, you could switch devices at the X cheapest number
of hours during the day.

### Gas market price

For the dynamic gas prices, only entities are created that display the
`current` and `next hour` price because the price is always fixed for
24 hours; new prices are published every morning at **05:00 UTC time**.

## Services

The energy and gas prices are exposed using [service calls](/docs/scripts/service-calls/). The services populate [response data](/docs/scripts/service-calls#use-templates-to-handle-response-data) with price data.

### Service `easyenergy.get_gas_prices`

Fetches the hourly prices for gas.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `config_entry` | no | Config entry to use. | 013713c172577bada2874a32dbe44feb
| `incl_vat` | no | Defines whether the prices include or exclude VAT. Defaults to True | False
| `start` | yes | Start time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00
| `end` | yes | End time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00

#### Response data

The response data is a dictionary with the gas timestamps and prices as string and float values.

```json
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-12-09 03:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.46914
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-12-09 04:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.46914
    }
  ]
}
```

### Service `easyenergy.get_energy_usage_prices`

Fetches the hourly prices for energy that you use (buy).

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `config_entry` | no | Config entry to use. | 013713c172577bada2874a32dbe44feb
| `incl_vat` | no | Defines whether the prices include or exclude VAT.  Defaults to True | False
| `start` | yes | Start time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00
| `end` | yes | End time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00

#### Response data

The response data is a dictionary with the energy timestamps as strings and prices as float values.

```json
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-12-09 03:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.08418
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-12-09 04:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.08758
    }
  ]
}
```

### Service `easyenergy.get_energy_return_prices`

Fetches the hourly prices for energy that you return (sell).

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `config_entry` | no | Config entry to use. | 013713c172577bada2874a32dbe44feb
| `start` | yes | Start time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00
| `end` | yes | End time to get prices from. Defaults to today 00:00:00 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00

#### Response data

The response data is a dictionary with the energy timestamps as strings and prices as float values.

```json
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-12-09 03:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.06957
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-12-09 04:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.07238
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add response to template sensor

You can use the response data in a template sensor that is updated every hour:

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        seconds: "*"
    action:
      - service: easyenergy.get_energy_usage_prices
        response_variable: response
        data:
          config_entry: "013713c172577bada2874a32dbe44feb"
          incl_vat: true
    sensor:
      - name: Energy prices
        device_class: timestamp
        state: "{{ now() }}"
        attributes:
          prices: "{{ response.prices }}"
```

{% endraw %}
