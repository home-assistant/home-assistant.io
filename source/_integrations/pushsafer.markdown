The [Pushsafer service](https://www.pushsafer.com/) is a platform for the notify component. This allows you to send messages to the user using Pushsafer.

In order to get a private or alias key you need to go to the [Pushsafer website](https://www.pushsafer.com) and register.

To use Pushsafer notifications, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: pushsafer
    private_key: YOUR_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
name:

  required: false

  type: string
private_key:
  description: Your private or alias key. Private key = send the notification to all devices with standard params, alias key send the notification to the devices stored in the alias with predefined params.
