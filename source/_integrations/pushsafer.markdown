The [Pushsafer service](https://www.pushsafer.com/) is a platform for the notify integration. This allows you to send messages to the user using Pushsafer.

In order to get a private or alias key you need to go to the [Pushsafer website](https://www.pushsafer.com) and register.

To use Pushsafer notifications, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
