The `wsdot` sensor will give you travel time information from the [Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)](https://wsdot.com/).

## Setup

First, you need to get a free Traveler Information `api_key` from the [WSDOT API webpage](https://wsdot.com/traffic/api/). Just enter your email address to instantly get the key.

## Configuration

Once you have the code, create `wsdot` sensors by editing your `configuration.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: wsdot
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
    travel_time:
     - id: 95
       name: I-90 Eastbound HOV
```

{% configuration %}
api_key:
  description: Your API key from WSDOT.
  required: true
  type: string
travel_time:
  description: List of routes.
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    id:
      description: ID of the route.
      required: true
      type: string
    name:
      description: Name of the route.
      required: false
      default: Just uses `id`
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

Figuring out which Travel Time ID (`id`) is associated with your routes is a bit of a challenge. If you visit `https://wsdot.com/Traffic/api/TravelTimes/TravelTimesREST.svc/GetTravelTimesAsJson?AccessCode=[your_api_key_here]` substituting your `api_key`, you will get a list of all available routes. Search through it and then find the key `TravelTimeID`. That tells you the number you need.

Some common examples include:

```text
 73 Issaquah-Seattle (WB PM)
 74 Seattle-Issaquah (EB AM)
 75 HOV Issaquah-Seattle (WB REV)
 76 Issaquah-Seattle (WB REV)
 77 HOV Redmond-Seattle (WB PM)
 78 HOV Seattle-Redmond (EB AM)
 79 Redmond-Seattle (WB PM)
 80 Seattle-Redmond (EB AM)
 81 HOV Redmond-Seattle via I-90 (WB PM)
 82 HOV Seattle-Redmond via I-90 (EB AM)
 83 Redmond-Seattle via I-90 (WB PM)
 84 Seattle-Redmond via I-90 (EB AM)
 85 HOV Redmond-Seattle via I-90 (WB REV)

<div class='note info'>
WSDOT does provide information about ferry schedules, mountain passes, tolls, etc. but so far only Travel Time data is available in this platform.
