The `denon` {% term integration %} allows you to control a Denon Network Receiver from Home Assistant. It might be that your device is supported by the [Denon AVR] platform.

Supported devices:

- Denon DRA-N5
- Denon RCD-N8 (untested)
- Denon RCD-N9 (partial support)
- Denon AVR receivers with integrated Network support (partial support)

To add a Denon Network Receiver to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

## Telnet platform

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: denon
    host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: true
  type: string

{% endconfiguration %}

A few notes for platform: denon

- The receiver handles only one telnet connection and refuses others.
- Be careful with the volume. 100% or even 50% is very loud.
- To be able to wake up the receiver, activate the "remote" setting in the receiver's settings.
- Play and pause are supported, toggling is not possible.
- Seeking cannot be implemented as the UI sends absolute positions. Only seeking via simulated button presses is possible.
