## Description

The [Notify.Events service](https://notify.events/) is a platform for the **notify** component. 

This platform allows you to quickly configure the distribution of messages between different recipients, no matter how they are used to receiving notifications: 

- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
- [Viber](https://viber.com/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/)
- [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)
- Jabber / XMPP
- Webpush
- SMS
- VoiceCall

You can find a full supported messenger list [here](https://notify.events/features).

## Setting up

To start getting notifications, you need to follow those simple steps:
 
1. SignUp to [Notify.Events](https://notify.events/) and create a Channel
2. Add **Home Assistant** source to this channel and get your **token**
3. Add the Notify.Events integration to your installation by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
notify_events:
  token: YOUR_TOKEN
```

{% configuration %}
token:
  description: Your channel source token.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

Now you can use notify_events integration as a platform for your **notify service**, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME (e.g. "events")
    platform: notify_events
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: "The optional parameter `name` allows multiple notifiers to be created. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`."
  required: false
  type: string
  default: notify
{% endconfiguration %}

### That's it!

Now you can use the `notify.events` service inside your Home Assistant to:
- Send any notifications or alerts
- Distribute events by `level` and `priority`
- Attach **files** and **images** (local or remote)
- .. and just keep using your favorite messenger to receive them!

### Example service call

```yaml
- service: notify.events
  data:
    message: "Backyard motion detected!"
    data:
      level: "warning"
      priority: "high"
      images:
        - name: "local_photo.jpg"
          path: "/tmp/backyard_cam/motion.jpg"
        - name: "remote_photo.jpg"
          url: "https://i.ibb.co/Jt1845X/motion.jpg"
```
