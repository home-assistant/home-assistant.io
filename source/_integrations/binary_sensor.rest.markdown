The `rest` binary sensor platform is consuming a given endpoint which is exposed
by a
[RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
of a device, an application, or a web service.
The binary sensor has support for GET and POST requests.

_Tip:_ If you want to create multiple `sensors` using the same endpoint, use the [RESTful](/integrations/rest) configuration instructions.

The JSON messages can contain different values like `1`, `"1"`,
`TRUE`, `true`, `on`, or `open`. If the value is nested then use a
[template](/docs/configuration/templating/#processing-incoming-data).

```json
{
    "name": "Binary sensor",
    "state": {
        "open": "true",
        "timestamp": "2016-06-20 15:42:52.926733"
    }
}
```

## Configuration

To enable this sensor,
add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file for a GET request:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rest
    resource: http://IP_ADDRESS/ENDPOINT
```

or for a POST request:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rest
    resource: http://IP_ADDRESS/ENDPOINT
    method: POST
```

or a template based request:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rest
    resource_template: "http://IP_ADDRESS/{{ now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}"
```

{% endraw %}

## Examples

In this section you find some real-life examples of how to use this sensor.

### aREST sensor

Instead of using an [aREST](/integrations/arest#binary-sensor) binary sensor,
you could retrieve the value of a device supporting
aREST directly with a REST binary sensor.

{% raw %}

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rest
    resource: http://192.168.0.5/digital/9
    method: GET
    name: Light
    device_class: light
    value_template: '{{ value_json.return_value }}'
```

{% endraw %}

### Accessing an HTTP authentication protected endpoint

The REST sensor supports HTTP authentication and template-enabled customized headers.

{% raw %}

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: rest
    resource: http://IP_ADDRESS:5000/binary_sensor
    username: ha1
    password: test1
    authentication: basic
    headers:
      User-Agent: Home Assistant
      Content-Type: application/json
      X-Custom-Header: '{{ states("input_text.the_custom_header") }}'
```

{% endraw %}


The headers will contain all relevant details. This will also give
you the ability to access endpoints that are protected by tokens.

```bash
Content-Length: 1024
Host: IP_ADDRESS1:5000
Authorization: Basic aGExOnRlc3Qx
Accept-Encoding: identity
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Home Assistant
```
