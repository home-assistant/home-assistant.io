The `icloud` integration allows you to detect presence using the [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/) service. iCloud allows users to track their location on iOS devices.

There is currently support for the following platforms within Home Assistant:

- [Device tracker](#device-tracker)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

It does require that your devices are registered with the [Find My](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/) service.

{% warning %}
You may receive an email and a notification from Apple saying that someone has logged into your account.

For the notification, press "Allow", then "OK".
{% endwarning %}

To prevent excessive battery drainage, a dynamic interval is used for each individual device instead of a fixed interval for all devices linked to one account. The dynamic interval is based on the current zone of a device, the distance towards home and the battery level of the device.

## Two Factor Authentication

If two-step authentication is enabled for your iCloud account, some time after Home Assistant startup the integration will ask to enter the verification code you receive on your device via a notification in the Home Assistant UI. The duration of this authentication is determined by Apple, so you will need to verify your account every now and then.

## In case of troubleshooting

Go into your Home Assistant configuration `.storage` folder and delete the `icloud` folder, then retry.

## Platforms

### Device tracker

The iCloud integration will track available devices on your iCloud account.

### Sensor

The iCloud integration will add a battery sensor for each iCloud devices available on your iCloud account.

## Services

4 services are available:

### Service `icloud.update`

This service can be used to ask an update of a certain iDevice or all devices linked to an iCloud account. Request will result in new Home Assistant [state_changed](/docs/configuration/events/#event-state_changed) event describing current iPhone location. It can be used in automations when a manual location update is needed, e.g., to check if anyone is home when a door has been opened.

### Service `icloud.play_sound`

This service will play the Lost iPhone sound on your iDevice. It will still ring if you are on "Mute" or "Do not disturb" mode.

| `device_name`             |       no | Human Friendly device name like Bob's iPhone            |

### Service `icloud.display_message`

This service will display a message on your iDevice. It can also ring your device.

### Service `icloud.lost_device`
