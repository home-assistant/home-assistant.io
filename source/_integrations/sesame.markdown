The `sesame` {% term integration %} allows you to control your [Sesame](https://candyhouse.co/) smart locks made by CANDY HOUSE, Inc.

## Configuration

Your Sesame needs to be paired with a standalone [Wi-Fi Access Point](https://candyhouse.co/collections/frontpage/products/wi-fi-access-point) purchased separately.

You will also need to generate an API key from [my.candyhouse.co](https://my.candyhouse.co/#/credentials).

Once you have remote access enabled using one of the above AND the Integration - cloud option enabled on the Sesame app for that lock settings, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
lock:
  - platform: sesame
    api_key: YOUR_SESAME_API_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
