The **Danfoss Air** {% term integration %} allows you to access information from your Danfoss Air HRV unit.

*Note*: Danfoss Air CCM only accepts one TCP connection at a time. Due to this the integration will not work while you have the HRV PC-Tool open.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

To enable Danfoss Air, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
danfoss_air:
  host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_CCM
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: Danfoss Air CCM IP.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}
