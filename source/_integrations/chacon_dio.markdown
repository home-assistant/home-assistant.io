[Chacon Dio devices](https://chacon.com/en/) are connected home devices that can be controlled via RF 433 MHz or Wi-Fi.
This {% term integrations %} gives you access to the Wi-Fi connection so that Home Assistant can list your Chacon Dio devices and interact with them in real time, the same way the vendor's smartphone application does.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Cover](#cover)
- [Switch](#switch)

## Prerequisites

You will need to use the standalone app for this device to register a username and password.

- [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/dio-one/id1493503504?l=en)

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Cover

The cover platform integrates Chacon Dio devices to manage covers (like the REV-SHUTTER model) into Home Assistant, enabling control of the following:

- get the **state** of the cover (connected or not, position and current movement)
- **Open/close/stop** the cover
- **Set position** of the cover (0-100%)

## Switch

The switch platform integrates Chacon Dio devices to manage switches (like the REV-SWITCH model) into Home Assistant, enabling control of the following:

- get the **state** of the switch (connected or not and on/off state)
- **Turn on/off** the switch

## Actions

In rare cases, such as  Wi-Fi interruptions, you may need to manually update the state of your devices. You can use the `homeassistant.update_entity` action to refresh the device state manually.

## Tips

You can use the [group integration](/integrations/group) to group entities as the application proposes (for example covers of the first floor).
You can use any Cover card to have a specific display of the covers.
