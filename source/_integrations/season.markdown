The season integration will provide the current astronomical or meteorological season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
as a sensor.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

For information on the difference between astronomical and meteorological seasons please see the link below:

All information about how the seasons work was taken from Wikipedia:

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Astronomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Astronomical)
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox)
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice)

To cut a long read short, Astronomical gives seasons based on the shortest/longest day and equinoxes. So in the Northern Hemisphere spring starts on 20 March). Meteorological gives seasons based on months (so in the Northern Hemisphere spring starts on 1 March).
