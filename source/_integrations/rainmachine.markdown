The RainMachine integration is the main integration to integrate all platforms related to [RainMachine smart Wi-Fi sprinkler controllers](https://www.rainmachine.com/).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary sensor
- Button
- Sensor
- [Switch](#switch)

Note that some entities are disabled by default. If you are missing a sensor or binary sensor, check the configured integration!

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Configuration Options

The integration has two configuration options: 

1. "Default Zone Run Time": sets a default duration when turning on a zone switch (default: 600 seconds). This can be overriden with a service call (see below). 
2. "Use Run Times from App": if enabled, will use the zone-specific run times from the last time the zone was turned on manually in the RainMachine App – this allows you to set per-zone default times using the RainMachine app instead of the same default time for all zones.

## Services

Services accept either device IDs or entity IDs, depending on the nature of the service:

- Services that require a device ID as a target:
  - `rainmachine.pause_watering`
  - `rainmachine.push_flow_meter_data`
  - `rainmachine.push_weather_data`
  - `rainmachine.restrict_watering`
  - `rainmachine.stop_all`
  - `rainmachine.unpause_watering`
  - `rainmachine.unrestrict_watering`
- Services that require an entity ID as a target (note that the correct entity ID type must be provided, such as a program for a program-related service)
  - `rainmachine.start_program`
  - `rainmachine.start_zone`
  - `rainmachine.stop_program`
  - `rainmachine.stop_zone`

### `rainmachine.pause_watering`

Pause all watering activities for a number of seconds. After the pause is complete, the previous watering activities will resume. Note that controllers can only be paused for a maximum of 12 hours.

| Service Data Attribute | Optional | Description                    |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `seconds`              | no       | The number of seconds to pause |

### `rainmachine.push_flow_meter_data`

Push Flow Meter data from Home Assistant to the RainMachine device.

| Service Data Attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`                | no       | The flow meter value to send. May be any positive number.                                                  |
| `unit_of_measurement`  | yes      | The flow meter units to send. String must be one of "clicks", "gal", "litre", or "m3"  (default: "litre"). |

### `rainmachine.push_weather_data`

Push Weather Data from Home Assistant to the RainMachine device.

Local Weather Push service should be enabled from Settings > Weather > Developer tab for RainMachine to consider the values being sent. Units must be sent in metric; no conversions are performed by the integration. Note: RAIN and QPF values shouldn't be sent as cumulative values but the measured/forecasted values for each hour or day. The RainMachine Mixer will sum all RAIN or QPF values in the current day to have the day total RAIN or QPF.

## Controlling Your Device

After Home Assistant loads, new switches will be added for every enabled program and zone. These work as expected:

- Program On/Off: starts/stops a program
- Zone On/Off: starts/stops a zone (using the configuration options described above to determine how long to run for)

Programs and zones are linked. While a program is running, you will see both the program and zone switches turned on; turning either one off will turn the other one off (just like in the web app).

## Entity Availability

Many RainMachine entities are enabled by default. Others, like those related to flow sensors, are disabled by default if they only apply to some controllers. You can view all entities for a controller and enable/disable them as appropriate in the Device screen for your RainMachine controller.

## Firmware Updates

The integration has an [update entity](/integrations/update/) that provides information on the latest available RainMachine firmware version. The firmware update can be triggered and installed onto your RainMachine controller
directly from Home Assistant.
