The `aprs` [(Automatic Packet Reporting System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System) device tracker integration connects to the [APRS-IS](http://aprs-is.net/) network for tracking amateur radio devices.

## Configuration

To enable APRS tracking in Home Assistant, add the following section to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
device_tracker:
  - platform: aprs
    username: FO0BAR  # or FO0BAR-1 to FO0BAR-15
    callsigns:
      - 'XX0FOO*'
      - 'YY0BAR-1'
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: "Your callsign (or callsign-SSID combination). This is used to connect to the host. Note: Do not use the same callsign or callsign-SSID combination as a device you intend to track: the APRS-IS network will not route the packets to Home Assistant. This is a known limitation of APRS packet routing."
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: Your APRS password. This will verify the connection.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: -1
callsigns:
  description: A list of callsigns you wish to track. Wildcard `*` is allowed. Any callsigns that match will be added as devices.
  required: true
  type: list
host:
  description: The APRS server to connect to.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: rotate.aprs2.net
timeout:
  description: The number of seconds to wait to connect to the APRS-IS network before giving up.
  required: false
  type: float
  default: 30.0
{% endconfiguration %}

Verified connections are only required to send data to the APRS-IS network, which the `aprs` platform does not yet do.
However, you are free to verify your connection if you know your APRS password.
