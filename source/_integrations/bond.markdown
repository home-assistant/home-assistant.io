The **Bond** {% term integration %} allows you to control appliances through your [Bond Bridge](https://bondhome.io/). Duplicates your RF remote control.

Supported devices (see Requirements section below):

## Prerequisites

To use Bond controlled devices in your installation, add your Bond hub host and access token from the integrations page. Instructions for how to obtain an access token can be found on the [Bond Local API](http://docs-local.appbond.com/#section/Getting-Started/Get-Device-Information) documentation, which includes a section for how to obtain the [IP address of the device](http://docs-local.appbond.com/#section/Getting-Started/Finding-the-Bond-IP) which you will need to obtain the access token.

Bond bridges with firmware v2.9.x and lower will **not** work correctly. Please
upgrade your firmware from Bond app before adding this integration.

## BPUP support (Push updates)
