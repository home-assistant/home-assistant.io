The Nanoleaf integration allows you to control and monitor Nanoleaf Light Panels, Canvas, Shapes, Elements, and Lines.

This integration does not support the Nanoleaf Remote and Essentials lights. Controlling Nanoleaf Essentials lights is possible over Thread and Bluetooth through the HomeKit Controller integration.

# Transition and brightness

When using a transition in service calls (such as `light.turn_on`), the transition is only applied to brightness and does not apply to color. When a service call has a transition set but no brightness is included, the light will automatically transition to 100% brightness.
