With the `freedns` integration you can keep your [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org) record up to date.

## Setup (Default API V1)

You need to determine your update URL or your access token.

1. Head over to the [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org) website and login to your account.
2. Select the menu "Dynamic DNS"
3. You should now see your update candidates in a table at the bottom of the page.
4. Copy the link target of the "Direct URL".
5. The access token is the part at the end of the link: `https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?YOUR_UPDATE_TOKEN`
6. Either put the token as `access_token` _or_ the whole URL into the `url` attribute.

## Configuration (API V1)

To use the integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
freedns:
  access_token: YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Setup (API V2)

You need to determine your update URL or your access token.

1. Head over to the [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org) website and login to your account.
2. Select the menu "Dynamic DNS"
3. You should now see your update candidates in a table at the bottom of the page.
4. Head over to page [Version 2](https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/v2/), and enable the candidate.
5. The access token is the part at the end of the link: `http://sync.afraid.org/u/RANDOMIZED_TOKEN/`
6. Put the whole URL into the `url` attribute.
7. (Instead of using the randomized token URL in the Version 2 there are other options to use for URL)

## Configuration (API V2)

To use the integration in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
freedns:
  url: http://sync.afraid.org/u/RANDOMIZED_TOKEN/
```
