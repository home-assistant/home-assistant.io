A universal media player can combine multiple existing entities in Home Assistant into a single media player {% term entity %}. This is used to create a single media player {% term entity %} that can control an entire media center.

Multiple media player entities may be controlled from a universal media player. Additionally, the universal media player can enable volume and power commands to be directed to other Home Assistant entities. This enables the media player power and volume commands to control devices like a television, amplifier or audio receiver, for example.

To use a universal media player add it to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.

{% endconfiguration %}

The universal media player will primarily imitate one of its `children`. The universal media player will control the first child on the list that is active (not idle/off). The universal media player will also inherit its state from the first active child if a `state_template` is not provided. Entities in the `children:` list must be media players, but the state template can contain any {% term entity %}.

Using `active_child_template` will allow you to specify an active {% term entity %} if the default behavior is unsuitable for your task. The template must return the `entity_id` of the child that will be selected as active or `None` to return the default behavior.

It is recommended that the command `turn_on`, the command `turn_off`, and the attribute `state` all be provided together. The `state` attribute indicates if the media player is on or off. If `state` indicates the media player is off, this status will take precedence over the states of the children. If all the children are idle/off and `state` is on, the Universal Media Player's state will be on. If not provided, the `toggle` command will delegate to `turn_on` or `turn_off` based on the `state`.

It is also recommended that the command `volume_up`, the command `volume_down`, the command `volume_mute`, and the attribute `is_volume_muted` all be provided together. The attribute `is_volume_muted` should return either True or the on state when the volume is muted. The `volume_mute` {% term action %} should toggle the mute setting.

When providing `select_source` as a command, it is recommended to also provide the attributes `source`, and `source_list`. The `source` attribute is the currently select source, while the `source_list` attribute is a list of all available sources.

When using `state_template`, if you use a template that depends on the current time it is recommended to use `now()`. Using `now()` will cause templates to be refreshed at the start of every new minute. For more information see the [time](/docs/configuration/templating/#time) section in the template documentation.

The `browse_media_entity` parameter allows you to specify which media player will be used in media browser.

## Usage examples

### Chromecast & Kodi control with switches

In this example, a switch is available to control the power to the television. Switches are also available to turn the volume up, turn the volume down, and mute the audio. These could be command line switches or any other {% term entity %} in Home Assistant. The `turn_on` and `turn_off` commands will be redirected to the television, and the volume commands will be redirected to an audio receiver. The `select_source` command will be passed directly to an A/V receiver.

The children are a Chromecast and a Kodi player. If the Chromecast is playing, the Universal Media Player will reflect its status. If the Chromecast is idle and Kodi is playing, the universal media player will change to reflect its status.

### Kodi CEC-TV control

In this example, a [Kodi Media Player](/integrations/kodi) runs in a CEC capable device (OSMC/OpenElec running in a Raspberry Pi 24/7, for example), and, with the JSON-CEC Kodi add-on installed, it can turn on and off the attached TV.

We store the state of the attached TV in an [input boolean](/integrations/input_boolean/), so we can differentiate the TV being on or off, while Kodi is always 'idle', and use the universal media player to render its state with a template. We now can differentiate between the 'idle' and the 'off' state (being the second when it is idle and the TV is off).

Because the input boolean used to store the TV state is only changing when using the Home Assistant `turn_on` and `turn_off` actions, and Kodi could be controlled by so many ways, we also define some automations to update this Input Boolean when needed.

The complete configuration is:

{% raw %}

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize:
    media_player.kodi_tv:
      friendly_name: Kodi

input_boolean:
  kodi_tv_state:

media_player:
  - platform: universal
    name: Kodi TV
    state_template: >
      {% if is_state('media_player.kodi', 'idle') and is_state('input_boolean.kodi_tv_state', 'off') %}
        off
      {% else %}
        {{ states('media_player.kodi') }}
      {% endif %}
    children:
      - media_player.kodi
    commands:
      turn_on:
        action: media_player.turn_on

### Denon AVR & HEOS

This media player combines the media players provided by the [Denon AVR](/integrations/denonavr/) and [HEOS](/integrations/heos/) integrations. 

Features:
- Volume control via Denon entity (might be more fine-granular than HEOS volume control)
- ON/OFF button via Denon entity (not provided by HEOS media player)
- Sound mode selector via Denon entity (not provided by HEOS media player)
- Album art & Metadata via HEOS entity (not provided by Denon media player)

The complete configuration is:

{% raw %}

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: universal

### Override active children

This example shows how you can use `active_child_template`:

{% raw %}

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: universal
    name: sony_tv
    unique_id: sony_tv
    children:
      - media_player.sony_tv_cast
      - media_player.sony_tv_psk
    active_child_template: >
      {% if is_state_attr('media_player.sony_tv_cast', 'app_name', 'TV') %}
         media_player.sony_tv_psk
      {% else %}
         media_player.sony_tv_cast
      {% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}
