The OpenSky integration allows one to track overhead flights in a given region. It uses crowd-sourced data from the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) public API. It will also fire Home Assistant events when flights enter and exit the defined region.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% configuration_basic %}
latitude:
  description: The latitude of the center of the area to track. Defaulted with the home's latitude.
longitude:
  description: The latitude of the center of the area to track. Defaulted with the home's longitude.
radius:
  description: The radius in meters around the latitude/longitude point to track.
altitude:
  description: The maximum altitude in meters in which the planes are tracked. No input (or 0) means all planes in the area are tracked.
{% endconfiguration_basic %}

## Authentication

By default, polling is done every 15 minutes not to hit the API limit.
More API requests are allowed as authenticated users.
You can add your credentials after setting up the integration.

## Events

- **opensky_entry**: Fired when a flight enters the region.
- **opensky_exit**: Fired when a flight exits the region.

Both events have two attributes in common:

- **sensor**: Name of `opensky` sensor that fired the event.
- **callsign**: Callsign of the flight.

**opensky_entry** has 4 additional attributes:

- **altitude**: Altitude of the flight in meters.
- **latitude**: Latitude of the flight in decimal.
- **longitude**: Longitude of the flight in decimal.
- **icao24**: The ICAO 24-bit address of the aircraft's transponder.

To receive notifications of the entering flights using the [Home Assistant Companion App](https://companion.home-assistant.io/), add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Flight entry notification"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: opensky_entry
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_<device_name>
      data:
        message: "Flight entry of {{ trigger.event.data.callsign }}"
```
{% endraw %}

One can also get a direct link to the OpenSky website to see the flight using the icao24 identification:

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Flight entry notification"
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: opensky_entry
    action:
      service: notify.mobile_app_<device_name>
      data:
        message: "Flight entry of {{ trigger.event.data.callsign }}"
        data:
          actions:
            - action: URI
              title: Track the flight
              uri: >-
                https://opensky-network.org/aircraft-profile?icao24={{
                trigger.event.data.icao24 }}
```
{% endraw %}
