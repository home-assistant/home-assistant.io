This integration enables Home Assistant to do device tracking of devices with a MAC address connected to a FortiGate from [Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com).

The integration relies on the [fortiosapi](https://pypi.org/project/fortiosapi/).
The integration has been tested both on FortiGate appliance and FortiGate VM running SW FortiOS v. 6.0.x and 6.2.0.

All devices with a MAC address identified by FortiGate would be tracked, this covers both Ethernet and Wi-Fi devices, including devices detected by LLDP.

The integration is based on the Home Assistant `device_tracker` platform.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
