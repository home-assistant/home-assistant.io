The **VIZIO SmartCast** {% term integration %} allows you to control [SmartCast](https://www.vizio.com/smartcast-app)-compatible TVs and sound bars (2016+ models).

## Find your device

If `zeroconf` discovery is enabled, your device will get discovered automatically. To discover your device manually, read the subsections below.

### Install `pyvizio` locally

<div class='note'>

If the `pip3` command is not found, try `pip` instead

</div>

- To install, run `pip3 install pyvizio` in your terminal.
- If `pyvizio` is already installed locally, make sure you are using the latest version by running `pip3 install --upgrade pyvizio` in your terminal.

### Discover devices

Find your device using the following command:

```bash
pyvizio --ip=0 discover
```

Write down its IP address and port number. If you have trouble finding a device you were expecting to, you can try increasing the discovery timeout period by adding the `--timeout` option (e.g., `pyvizio --ip=0 discover --timeout=10`).

## Pairing

This {% term integration %} requires an access token in order to communicate with TVs (speakers do not need an access token). An access token can be obtained by going through a pairing process, either manually, or through the Home Assistant frontend.

### Pair using the Home Assistant frontend

 - **Using `configuration.yaml`:** If you have a `vizio` entry in `configuration.yaml` but don't provide an access token value in your configuration, after you initialize Home Assistant, you will see a VIZIO SmartCast device ready to be configured. When you open the configuration window, you will be guided through the pairing process. While Home Assistant will store the access token for the life of your `vizio` {% term entity %}, it is a good idea to note the access token value displayed in the window and add it to your `configuration.yaml`. This will ensure that you will not have to go through the pairing process again in the future if you decide to rebuild your Home Assistant instance.
- **Using discovery or manual setup through the Integrations menu:** To initiate the pairing process, submit your initial configuration with an empty Access Token value.

### Pair manually using the CLI

The following script, written by [JeffLIrion](https://github.com/JeffLIrion) can be run to obtain an auth token. You will need to replace `<IP>` with your IP and `<PORT>` (which is typically 7345 or 9000).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

VIZIO_IP="<IP>"
VIZIO_PORT="<PORT>"

curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"DEVICE_ID":"pyvizio","DEVICE_NAME":"Python Vizio"}' https://${VIZIO_IP}:${VIZIO_PORT}/pairing/start

read -p "PIN:  " VIZIO_PIN
read -p "PAIRING_REQ_TOKEN:  " VIZIO_PAIRING_REQ_TOKEN

curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"DEVICE_ID": "pyvizio","CHALLENGE_TYPE": 1,"RESPONSE_VALUE": "'"${VIZIO_PIN}"'","PAIRING_REQ_TOKEN": '"${VIZIO_PAIRING_REQ_TOKEN}"'}' https://${VIZIO_IP}:${VIZIO_PORT}/pairing/pair
```

### Pair manually using `pyvizio`

To obtain an auth token manually, follow these steps:

Make sure that your device is on before continuing.

| Parameter     | Description                                                             |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip`          | `IP Address:Port` (obtained from the previous section)                  |
| `device_type` | The type of device you are connecting to. Options are `tv` or `speaker` |

Enter the following command to initiate pairing:

```bash
pyvizio --ip={ip:port} --device_type={device_type} pair
```

Initiation will show you two different values:

| Value           | Description                                                                                             |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Challenge type  | Usually, it should be `"1"`.                                                                            |
| Challenge token | Token required to finalize pairing in the next step                                                     |

At this point, a PIN code should be displayed at the top of your TV. With all these values, you can now finish pairing:

```bash
pyvizio --ip={ip:port} --device_type={device_type} pair-finish --token={challenge_token} --pin={pin} --ch_type={challenge_type}
```

You will need the authentication token returned by this command to configure Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To add your VIZIO TV to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
vizio:
  - host: "DEVICE_IP:DEVICE_PORT"
    access_token: AUTH_TOKEN
```

{% configuration %}

            APP_ID: 9
            NAME_SPACE: 9
            MESSAGE: MY_MESSAGE
```

### Obtaining an app configuration

If there is an app you want to be able to launch from Home Assistant that isn't detected by default, you will need to specify the app configuration in `configuration.yaml`. This configuration can be obtained from the `app_id` state attribute when an unknown app is running on your device.

### Obtaining a list of valid apps to include or exclude

The list of apps that are provided by default is statically defined [here](https://github.com/vkorn/pyvizio/blob/master/pyvizio/const.py#L23). If you'd prefer a more concise list, you can either view the source list of a VIZIO Smart TV in the Home Assistant frontend, or run the following command (requires `pyvizio` to be installed locally):

```bash
pyvizio --ip=0 get-apps-list
```

## Service `vizio.update_setting`

This service allows you to update a setting on a given VIZIO device. You will need to know the type of setting and the name of the setting to call this service. You can determine this by using the SmartCast app and going to device settings for your target device. The setting type is the lowercase version of the first menu item you'd select (e.g., display, audio, system), and the setting name is what you see in the app, but spaces are replaced with underscores and it is also all lowercase (e.g., AV delay would be called `av_delay`).

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `entity_id` | yes | The devices to update a setting for. | `media_player.vizio_smartcast`
| `setting_type` | no | The type of setting. | `audio`
| `setting_name` | no | The name of the setting. | `eq`
| `new_value` | no | The new value to set the setting to. | `Music`

## Notes and limitations

### Turning device on

If the `Power Mode` of your device is set to `Eco Mode`, turning the device on won't work.

### Changing tracks

Changing tracks works like switching channels. If the current input is anything other than regular TV, this command might not do anything.
