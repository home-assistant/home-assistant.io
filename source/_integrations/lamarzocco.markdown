This integration interacts with [La Marzocco](https://lamarzocco.com/it/en/) coffee machines through calls to the La Marzocco cloud API. Optionally, local API calls, which include a WebSocket connection for (near) real-time updates and a Bluetooth connection, can be utilized for local connections.

If your machine is in Bluetooth range to your Home Assistant host and the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is fully loaded, the machine will be discovered automatically.

## Prerequisites

- To be able to configure your machine in Home Assistant, your machine needs to be added to your account using the official La Marzocco app first.
- Only login with username & password is supported. If you are currently using a social login, you need to create a new La Marzocco account and transfer your machine to it to be able to use this integration.

## Automations

Get started with these automation examples.

### Turn steamboiler on when machine is turned on

I often drink milk beverages in the morning and espresso in the afternoon, but forget to re-enable the steamboiler again, so this automation ensures that the steam boiler is always turned on, when the machine is turned on.

{% details "Example YAML configuration" %}

{% raw %}

```yaml
alias: Turn steamboiler on when machine is turned on
description: Ensure the steamboiler is on, when the machine gets turned on
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - switch.mr000000
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: switch.mr000000_steam_boiler
    state: "off"
actions:
  - action: switch.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: switch.mr000000_steam_boiler
    data: {}
mode: single

```
{% endraw %}
{% enddetails %}
  
## Known Limitations

- Only La Marzocco native app accounts are supported, social logins (Google, Apple & WeChat) are not supported
- Currently it is only possible to view the schedules configured in the La Marzocco Home app, but not to edit the schedules from Home Assistant. You can, of course, build Home Assistant native automations to reflect the same functionality in Home Assistant.

## Troubleshooting

{% details "Problem: Connection to machine is not possible" %}

Check the La Marzocco Home app to see if you can connect to your machine there. If not, remove the machine and add it again (follow the instructions in the La Marzocco App).
{% enddetails %}

{% details "Real time updates are not available" %}

Check the La Marzocco Home app to see if your machine is connected to Wi-Fi. Ensure Home Assistant can reach the machine. Ensure you configured the host option in the integration options.
