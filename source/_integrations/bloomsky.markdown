The **BloomSky** {% term integration %} allows you to access your [BloomSky](https://www.bloomsky.com/) weather station's.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Camera](#camera)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

## Setup

Obtain your API key from your [BloomSky dashboard](https://dashboard.bloomsky.com). Click `developers` in the bottom left of the screen.

## Configuration

To integrate your BloomSky hub with Home Assistant, add the following section to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
bloomsky:
  api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

{% configuration %}
api_key:
  description: Your BloomSky API key.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Binary sensor

The `bloomsky` binary sensor platform allows you to get data from your BloomSky device.

To get your BloomSky binary sensors working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions above first.

### Configuration

To use your BloomSky binary sensor in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: bloomsky
    monitored_conditions:
      - Night
      - Rain
```

{% configuration %}
monitored_conditions:
  description: "The sensors that you wish to monitor on all of your devices. Select from these options:"
  required: true
  type: list
  keys:
    night:
      description: Night
    rain:
      description: Rain
{% endconfiguration %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: bloomsky
```

## Sensor

The `bloomsky` sensor integration allows you to view the measurements made by sensors in the [BloomSky](https://www.bloomsky.com) weather station. This can work in concert with the [BloomSky camera](#camera).

### Configuration

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  platform: bloomsky
  monitored_conditions:
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Pressure
    - UVIndex
    - Luminance
    - Voltage
```

{% configuration %}
monitored_conditions:
  description: "The sensors that you wish to monitor on all of your devices. Select from these options:"
  required: true
