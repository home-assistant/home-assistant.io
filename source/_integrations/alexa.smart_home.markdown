Amazon Alexa provides a Smart Home API for richer home automation control without requiring the user to say the skill name, such as:

- _"Alexa, turn off the light."_
- _"Alexa, set the thermostat to cool."_
- _"Alexa, is the garage door open?"_

It takes considerable effort to configure. Your Home Assistant instance must be accessible from the Internet, and you need to create an Amazon Developer account and an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. An easier solution is to use [Home Assistant Cloud](/integrations/cloud/).

The [Emulated Hue integration][emulated-hue-component] provides a simpler alternative to use utterances such as _"Alexa, turn on the kitchen light"_. However, it has some limitations since everything looks like a light bulb.

<div class='note'>

With [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/), you can connect your Home Assistant instance in a few simple clicks to Amazon Alexa. With Home Assistant Cloud you don't have to deal with dynamic DNS, SSL certificates or opening ports on your router. Just log in via the user interface and a secure connection with the cloud will be established. Home Assistant Cloud requires a paid subscription after a 30-day free trial.

Steps to Integrate an Amazon Alexa Smart Home Skill with Home Assistant:

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Create an Amazon Alexa Smart Home Skill](#create-an-amazon-alexa-smart-home-skill)
- [Create an AWS Lambda Function](#create-an-aws-lambda-function)
  - [Create an IAM Role for Lambda](#create-an-iam-role-for-lambda)
  - [Add Code to the Lambda Function](#add-code-to-the-lambda-function)
  - [Test the Lambda Function](#test-the-lambda-function)
- [Configure the Smart Home Service Endpoint](#configure-the-smart-home-service-endpoint)
- [Account Linking](#account-linking)
- [Alexa Smart Home Component Configuration](#alexa-smart-home-component-configuration)
- [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms)
- [Alexa Web-Based App](#alexa-web-based-app)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
- [Debugging](#debugging)

## Requirements

- The Alexa Smart Home API requires your Home Assistant instance to be accessible from the internet via HTTPS on port 443 using an SSL/TLS certificate. A self-signed certificate will work, but a certificate signed by [an Amazon approved certificate authority](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/mozilla/IncludedCACertificateReport) is recommended. Read more on [our blog](/blog/2015/12/13/setup-encryption-using-lets-encrypt/) about how to set up encryption for Home Assistant. When running Home Assistant using the [Duck DNS](/addons/duckdns/) add-on is the easiest method.
- Amazon Developer Account. Sign up [here](https://developer.amazon.com).
- An [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) account is required to host the Lambda function for your Alexa Smart Home Skill. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) is free to use for up to 1-million requests and 1GB outbound data transfer per month.

## Create an Amazon Alexa Smart Home Skill

- Sign in [Alexa Developer Console][alexa-dev-console], you can create your free account on the sign in page.
- Go to `Alexa Skills` page if you are not, click `Create Skill` button to start the process.
- Input `Skill name` as you like, select your skill's `Default language`.
- Select `Smart Home` and `Provision your own`, then click `Create skill` button at top right corner.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/integrations/alexa/create_a_new_skill.png' alt='Screenshot: Create Smart Home skill'>
</p>

- In next screen, make sure *v3* is selected in `Payload version`.
- Now, you have created a skeleton of Smart Home skill. Next step we will do some "real" developer work. You can keep Alexa Developer Console opened, we need change the skill configuration later.

## Create an AWS Lambda Function

Alexa Smart Home skill will trigger a AWS Lambda function to process the request, we will write a small piece of code hosted as an Lambda function basically redirect the request to your Home Assistant instance, then the Alexa integration in Home Assistant will process the request and send back the response. Your Lambda function will deliver the response back to Alexa.

<div class='info'>

There already are some great tutorials and solutions in our community to achieve same goal "Create your Alexa Smart Home Skill to connect Home Assistant", for example: [haaska](https://github.com/mike-grant/haaska/wiki).

You can follow this document or others, but you cannot mixed-match different solutions since they may have different design.

Amazon also provided a [step-by-step guide](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smarthome/steps-to-build-a-smart-home-skill.html) to create a Smart Home Skill, however you have to adapt its sample code to match Home Assistant API.

</div>

OK, let's go. You first need to sign in to your [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), if you don't have an AWS account yet, you can create a new user [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) with 12-month free tire benefit. You don't need worry the cost if your account already pass the first 12 months, AWS provides up to 1 million Lambda request, 1GB outbound data and all inbound data for free, every month, all users. See [Lambda pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) for details.

### Create an IAM Role for Lambda

First thing you need to do after sing in [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) is to create an IAM Role for Lambda execution. AWS has very strict access control, you have to specific define and assign the permissions.

- Click `Services` in top navigation bar, expand the menu to display all AWS services, click `IAM` under `Security, Identity, & Compliance` section to navigate to IAM console. Or you may use this [link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
- Click `Roles` in the left panel, then click `Create role`, select `AWS Service` -> `Lambda` in the first page of the wizard, then click `Next: Permissions`
- Select `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` policy, then click `Next: Tags`. (Tips: you can use the search box to filter the policy)

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/integrations/alexa/create_iam_role_attach_permission.png' alt='Screenshot: Attach permission policy to IAM role'>
</p>

- You can skip `Add tags` page, click `Next: Review`.
- Give your new role a name, such as `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole-SmartHome`, then click `Create role` button. You should be able to find your new role in the roles list now.

### Add Code to the Lambda Function

Next you need create a Lambda function.

- Click `Services` in top navigation bar, expand the menu to display all AWS services, click `Lambda` under `Compute` section to navigate to Lambda console. Or you may use this [link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home)
- **IMPORTANT - Alexa Skills are only supported in certain AWS reigons** Your current server location will be displayed on the top right corner (for example, Ohio), make sure you select the server closest to your location / region based on your Amazon account's country, whilst also ensuring that it is within one of the supported reigons for Alexa Skills otherwise this will not work!
  - **US East (N.Virginia)** region for English (US) or English (CA) skills
  - **EU (Ireland)** region for English (UK), English (IN), German (DE), Spanish (ES) or French (FR) skills
  - **US West (Oregon)** region for Japanese and English (AU) skills.

- Click `Functions` in the left navigation bar, display list of your Lambda functions.
- Click `Create function`, select `Author from scratch`, then input a `Function name`.
- Select *Python 3.6*, *Python 3.7* or *Python 3.8* as `Runtime`.
- Make sure select *Use an existing role* as `Execution role`, then select the role you just created from `Existing role` list.
- Click `Create function`, then you can configuration detail of Lambda function.
- Under `Configuration` tab, expand `Designer` (if it isn't already expanded), then click `+ Add trigger` in the left part of the panel, then click `Alexa Smart Home` from the drop down list to add a Alexa Smart Home trigger to your Lambda function.
- You will then be prompted to input the `Skill ID` from the skill you created in previous step. (Tips: you may need switch back to Alexa Developer Console to copy the `Skill ID`.) Then click `Add`.
- Click your Lambda function icon in the middle of the diagram (above Layers), scroll down you will see a `Function code` window.
- Clear the example code, copy the Python script from: [https://gist.github.com/matt2005/744b5ef548cc13d88d0569eea65f5e5b](https://gist.github.com/matt2005/744b5ef548cc13d88d0569eea65f5e5b) (modified code to support Alexa's proactive mode, see details below)
- Click `Deploy` button to publish updated code.
- Scroll down a little bit, you will find `Environment variables`, you need add 1 environment variable and, if required, 3 optional variables. This is done by selecting `Manage environment variables` then adding the following:
  - *(required)* Key = BASE_URL, Value = your Home Assistant instance's Internet accessible URL with port if needed. *Do not include the trailing `/`*.
  - *(optional)* Key = NOT_VERIFY_SSL, Value = *True*. You can set this to *True* to ignore SSL issues, for example if you don't have a valid SSL certificate or you are using a self-signed certificate.
  - *(optional)* Key = DEBUG, Value = *True*. Set this variable to log the debug message and to allow the LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN
  - *(optional, not recommend)* Key = LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN, Value = your Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token. To avoid the use of a long-lived access token you will connect your Alexa Smart Home skill with your Home Assistant user account in the later steps, meaning you don't need to add it here. However, the access token you got from login flow is only valid for 30 minutes. It will be hard for you to test lambda function with the access token in test data. So for your convenience, you can remove the access token from the test data, [generate a long-lived access token][generate-long-lived-access-token] put here, then the function will fall back to read token from environment variables. (tips: You did not enable the security storage for your environment variables, so your token saved here is not that safe. You should only use it for debugging and testing purpose. You should remove and delete the long-lived access token after you finish the debugging.)

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/integrations/alexa/lambda_function_env_var.png' alt='Screenshot: Environment variables in Lambda function'>
</p>

- Now click the `Save` button in the bottom right hand corner.
- You will then be brought back to your function configuration. From here you need to select `Save` in the top right hand corner of the screen.
- You also need to copy the ARN displayed in the top of the page, which is the identity of this Lambda function. You will need this ARN to continue Alexa Smart Home skill configuration later.

### Test the Lambda Function

Now, you have created the Lambda function, before you can test it, you have to set up the necessary aspects of your Home Assistant configuration. Put the following minimal configuration into your `configuration.yaml` file. It will expose all of your supported devices and automations to Alexa. Check the [configuration section](#alexa-smart-home-component-configuration) if you want more control of the exposure.

```yaml
alexa:
  smart_home:
```

After your Home Assistant has restarted, go back to `AWS Lambda Console`, you are going to do some tests.

- On the top of your Lambda function configuration page, there is a `Test` button, to the left of this button is a drop down button - click this and select `Configure test events`
- Select `Create new test event`
- Name your event, for example `Discovery`
- Enter the following data into the code box below `Event name`:

```json
{
  "directive": {
    "header": {
      "namespace": "Alexa.Discovery",
      "name": "Discover",
      "payloadVersion": "3",
      "messageId": "1bd5d003-31b9-476f-ad03-71d471922820"
    },
    "payload": {
      "scope": {
        "type": "BearerToken"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- Click `Create` in the bottom right hand corner.

This test event is a `Discovery` directive, your Home Assistant instance will respond with a list of devices Alexa can interact with. This test data is lack of `token` in `payload.scope`, your Lambda function will read the `LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN` from environment variable.

Click the `Test` button. If you don't have `LONG_LIVED_ACCESS_TOKEN`, or you haven't enabled `DEBUG` you will get a `INVALID_AUTHORIZATION_CREDENTIAL` response as the execution result.

Now, you can login to your Home Assistant and [generate a long-lived access token][generate-long-lived-access-token]. After you put your long-lived access token to the `Environment variable` and set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `True`, do not forget to click the `Save` button before you `Test` again.

This time, you will get a list of your devices in the response. 🎉

## Configure the Smart Home Service Endpoint

Now remove the long-lived access token (if you want), copy the ARN of your Lambda function, then navigate back to [Alexa Developer Console][alexa-dev-console]. You will finish the configuration of the Smart Home skill.

- Sign in [Alexa Developer Console][alexa-dev-console], go to `Alexa Skills` page if you are not.
- Find the skill you just created, click `Edit` link in the `Actions` column.
- Click `SMART HOME` in the left navigation bar of build page.
- Fill in `Default endpoint` under `2. Smart Home service endpoint` using the `ARN` you copied from your Lambda function configuration.

## Account Linking

Alexa can link your Amazon account to your Home Assistant account. Therefore Home Assistant can make sure only authenticated Alexa request be able to access your home's devices. In order to link the account, you have to make sure your Home Assistant can be accessed from Internet.

- Sign in [Alexa Developer Console][alexa-dev-console], go to `Alexa Skills` page if you are not.
- Find the skill you just created, click `Edit` link in the `Actions` column.
- Click `ACCOUNT LINKING` in the left navigation bar of build page
- Do not turn on the "Allow users to link their account to your skill from within your application or website" switch. This will require a Redirect URI, which won't work.
- Input all information required. Assuming your Home Assistant can be accessed by `https://[YOUR HOME ASSISTANT URL:PORT]`
  - `Authorization URI`: `https://[YOUR HOME ASSISTANT URL]/auth/authorize`
  - `Access Token URI`: `https://[YOUR HOME ASSISTANT URL]/auth/token`
    - Note: you must use a valid/trusted SSL Certificate for account linking to work
  - `Client ID`:
    - `https://pitangui.amazon.com/` if you are in US
    - `https://layla.amazon.com/` if you are in EU
    - `https://alexa.amazon.co.jp/` if you are in JP and AU (not verified yet)

    The trailing slash is important here.

  - `Client Secret`: input anything you like, Home Assistant does not check this field
  - `Your Authentication Scheme`: make sure you selected *Credentials in request body*. Home Assistant does not support *HTTP Basic*.
  - `Scope`: Click `+ Add scope` and input `smart_home`, Home Assistant is not using it yet, we may use it in the future when we allow more fine-grained access control.
- You can leave `Domain List` and `Default Access Token Expiration Time` as empty.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/integrations/alexa/account_linking.png' alt='Screenshot: Account Linking'>
</p>

- Click `Save` button in the top right corner.
- Next, you will use Alexa Mobile App or [Alexa web-based app](#alexa-web-based-app) to link your account.
  - Open the Alexa app, navigate to `Skills & Games` -> `Your Skills` -> `Dev`
  - Click the Smart Home skill you just created.
  - Click `Enable to use`.
  - A new window will open to direct you to your Home Assistant's login screen.
  - After you successfully login, you will be redirected back to Alexa app.
  - You can discover your devices now!
- Now, you can ask your Echo or in Alexa App, _"Alexa, turn on bedroom"_ 🎉

### Alexa Locale

The `locale` should match the location and language used for your Amazon echo devices.

The supported locales are:

- `de-DE`
- `en-AU`
- `en-CA`
- `en-GB`
- `en-IN`
- `en-US`
- `es-ES`
- `es-MX`
- `es-US`
- `fr-CA`
- `fr-FR`
- `hi-IN`
- `it-IT`
- `ja-JP`
- `pt-BR`

See [List of Capability Interfaces and Supported Locales][alexa-supported-locales].

### Proactive Events

The `endpoint`, `client_id` and `client_secret` are optional, and are only required if you want to enable Alexa's proactive mode (i.e., "Send Alexa Events" enabled). Please note the following if you want to enable proactive mode:

- There are different endpoint URLs, depending on the region of your skill. Please check the available endpoints at <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smarthome/send-events-to-the-alexa-event-gateway.html#endpoints>
- The `client_id` and `client_secret` are not the ones used by the skill that have been set up using "Login with Amazon" (in the [Alexa Developer Console][amazon-dev-console]: Build > Account Linking), but rather from the "Alexa Skill Messaging" (in the Alexa Developer Console: Build > Permissions > Alexa Skill Messaging). To get them, you need to enable the "Send Alexa Events" permission.
- If the "Send Alexa Events" permission was not enabled previously, you need to unlink and relink the skill using the Alexa App, or else Home Assistant will show the following error: "Token invalid and no refresh token available. Also, you need to restart your Home Assistant after each disabling/enabling the skill in Alexa."

### Configure Filter

By default, no entity will be excluded. To limit which entities are being exposed to Alexa, you can use the `filter` parameter. Keep in mind that only [supported platforms](#supported-platforms) can be added.

```yaml
# Example filter to include specified domains and exclude specified entities
alexa:
  smart_home:
    filter:
      include_domains:
        - alarm_control_panel
        - light
      include_entity_globs:
        - binary_sensor.*_occupancy
      exclude_entities:
        - light.kitchen_light
```

Filters are applied as follows:

1. No includes or excludes - pass all entities
2. Includes, no excludes - only include specified entities
3. Excludes, no includes - only exclude specified entities
4. Both includes and excludes:
   - Include domain and/or glob patterns specified
      - If domain is included, and entity not excluded or match exclude glob pattern, pass
      - If entity matches include glob pattern, and entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
      - If domain is not included, glob pattern does not match, and entity not included, fail
   - Exclude domain and/or glob patterns specified and include does not list domains or glob patterns
      - If domain is excluded and entity not included, fail
      - If entity matches exclude glob pattern and entity not included, fail
      - If entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
   - Neither include or exclude specifies domains or glob patterns
      - If entity is included, pass (as #2 above)
      - If entity include and exclude, the entity exclude is ignored

See the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if for issues setting up the integration.

### Alexa Display Categories

Configure a display category to override the display category and iconography each entity is shown in the Alexa app. This makes it easier to find and monitor devices.

```yaml
light.kitchen_light:
  display_categories: LIGHT,SWITCH
```

<div class='note info'>
Devices such as cameras, doorbells, garage doors, and alarm control panels require specific display categories to provide all available features from Amazon Alexa. Overriding the default display category will limit features provided by Amazon Alexa.
</div>

See [Alexa Display Categories][alexa-display-categories] for a complete list

### Alarm Control Panel

Arm and disarm Alarm Control Panel entities. Ask Alexa for the state of the Alarm Control Panel entity.

- _"Alexa, arm my home in away mode."_
- _"Alexa, arm my home."_
- _"Alexa, disarm my home."_
- _"Alexa, is my home armed?"_

#### Arming

The Alarm Control Panel state must be in the `disarmed` state before arming. Alexa does not support switching from an armed state without first disarming, e.g., switching from `armed_home` to `armed_night`.

The Alarm Control Panel state `armed_custom_bypass` isn't supported by Alexa and is treated as `armed_home`.

<div class="note">

Alexa does not support arming with voice PIN at this time. Therefore if the Alarm Control Panel requires a `code` for arming or the `code_arm_required` attribute is `true`, the entity will not be exposed during discovery.
The Alarm Control Panel may default the `code_arm_required` attribute to `true` even if the platform does not support or require it. Use the [Entity Customization Tool](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#customization-using-the-ui) to override `code_arm_required` to `false` and expose the Alarm Control Panel during discovery.

</div>

#### Disarming

Users must opt-in to the disarm by voice feature in the Alexa App. Alexa will require a 4 digit voice personal identification number (PIN) for disarming. Configure a 4 digit PIN in the Alexa app, or use an existing 4 digit PIN code configured for the Alarm Control Panel.

<p class='img'>
<a href='/images/integrations/alexa/alexa_app_security_system_pin.png' target='_blank'>
  <img height='460' src='/images/integrations/alexa/alexa_app_security_system_pin.png' alt='Screenshot: Alexa App Security System PIN'/></a>
</p>

To use the exiting code configured for the Alarm Control Panel the `code` must be 4 digits and the `code_format` attribute must be `FORMAT_NUMBER`. After discovery, the Alexa app will offer the ability to use the existing `code`, or create an additional 4 digit PIN to use with Alexa.

The existing code is never communicated to Alexa from Home Assistant. During disarming, Alexa will ask for a PIN. The PIN spoken to Alexa is relayed to Home Assistant and passed to the `alarm_control_panel.alarm_disarm` service. If the `alarm_control_panel.alarm_disarm` service fails for any reason, it is assumed the PIN was incorrect and reported to Alexa as an invalid PIN.

### Alert, Automation, Group, Input Boolean

Turn on and off Alerts, Automations, Groups, and Input Boolean entities as switches.

- _"Alexa, turn on the front door alert."_
- _"Alexa, turn off energy saving automations."_
- _"Alexa, Downstairs to on."_

### Binary Sensor

Requires [Proactive Events](#proactive-events) enabled.

Binary Sensors with a [`device_class`](/integrations/binary_sensor/#device-class) attribute of `door` `garage_door` `opening` `window` `motion` `presense` are supported.

| `device_class` | Alexa Sensor Type |
| :------------: | :---------------: |
|     `door`     |      Contact      |
| `garage_door`  |      Contact      |
|   `opening`    |      Contact      |
|    `window`    |      Contact      |
|    `motion`    |      Motion       |
|   `presense`   |      Motion       |

Ask Alexa for the state of a contact sensor.

- _"Alexa, is the bedroom window open?"_

#### Routines

Requires [Proactive Events](#proactive-events) enabled.

Alexa Routines can be triggered with Binary Sensors exposed as contact or motion sensors.

Use the [Entity Customization Tool](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#customization-using-the-ui) to override the `device_class` attribute to expose a `binary_sensor` to Alexa.

#### Doorbell Announcement

Requires [Proactive Events](#proactive-events) enabled.

Configure a `binary_sensor` with `display_category` of `DOORBELL` in the [`entity_config`](#entity_config) to gain access to the doorbell notification settings in the Alexa App.

```yaml
alexa:
  smart_home:
    entity_config:
      binary_sensor.alexa_doorbell:
        name: "Front Door"
        description: "Doorbell Binary Sensor"
        display_categories: DOORBELL
```

Alexa will announce on all echo devices _"Someone is at the [entity name]"_ when a `binary_sensor` state changes from `off` to `on`.

<div class='note info'>
Each Amazon Echo device will need the communication and announcements setting enabled, and the Do Not Disturb feature turned off.
</div>

<p class='img'>
<a href='/images/integrations/alexa/alexa_app_doorbell_announcement.png' target='_blank'>
  <img height='460' src='/images/integrations/alexa/alexa_app_doorbell_announcement.png' alt='Screenshot: Alexa App Doorbell Notification'/></a>
</p>

#### Presence Detection with Binary Sensor

Requires [Proactive Events](#proactive-events) enabled.

Configure a `binary_sensor` that has a `device_class` attribute of `motion` or `presence` and configure `display_category` to `CAMERA` in the [`entity_config`](#entity_config) to gain access the presence detected notification settings in the Alexa App.

```yaml
alexa:
  smart_home:
    entity_config:
      binary_sensor.driveway_presence:
        name: "Driveway"
        description: "Driveway Presence Sensor"
        display_categories: CAMERA
```

Alexa will announce on all echo devices _"Person detected at [entity name]"_.

<div class="note">

Each Echo device will need the communication and Announcements setting enabled, and the Do Not Disturb feature turned off.

</div>

 <p class='img'>
   <a href='/images/integrations/alexa/alexa_app_person_detection.png' target='_blank'>
   <img height='460' src='/images/integrations/alexa/alexa_app_person_detection.png' alt='Screenshot: Alexa App Person Detection Notification'/></a>
 </p>

[Image Processing](#image-processing) entities also support this notification.

### Camera

View a camera stream on an Amazon echo device.

- _"Alexa, show the front door camera."_

The [`stream`](/integrations/stream/) integration is required to stream cameras to Amazon echo devices.

The Amazon echo device will request the camera stream from Home Assistant. The Home Assistant URL must be accessible from the network the Amazon echo device is connected to and must support HTTPS on port 443 with a certificate signed by [an Amazon approved certificate authority](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/mozilla/IncludedCACertificateReport). These requirements can be satisfied with Home Assistant Cloud, or LetsEncrypt/DuckDNS.

Enable preload stream option for cameras used with echo devices to reduce response time, and prevent timing out before the 6 second limit.   

### Climate

Single, double, and triple set-point thermostats are supported. The temperature value from the thermostat will also be exposed at a separate [temperature sensor](#sensor).

#### Set Thermostat Temperature

- _"Alexa, set thermostat to 20."_
- _"Alexa, set the AC to 75."_
- _"Alexa, make it warmer in here."_
- _"Alexa, make it cooler in here."_

#### Thermostat Mode

- _"Alexa, set living room thermostat to automatic."_

- `DRY` is shown in Alexa app as `DEHUMIDIFY`
- `ECO` is handled as a `preset` in Home Assistant, and will not display in the Alexa app.
- `FAN_ONLY` is not supported by the Alexa voice model and is shown as `OFF` in the Alexa App.

To change the thermostat mode, the exact utterance must be used:

- _"Alexa, set [entity name] to [mode utterance]."_

If the climate entity supports on/off, use _"turn on"_ and _"turn off"_ utterances with the entity name or the mode utterance.

- _"Alexa, turn on the [mode utterance]."_
- _"Alexa, turn off the [entity name]."_

Alexa supports the following utterances value for climate thermostat mode:

| HA Climate Mode | Alexa Mode Utterances   |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AUTO`          | _"auto"_, _"automatic"_ |
| `COOL`          | _"cool"_, _"cooling"_   |
| `HEAT`          | _"heat"_, _"heating"_   |
| `ECO`           | _"eco"_, _"economical"_ |
| `DRY`           | _"dry"_, _"dehumidify"_ |
| `OFF`           | _"off"_                 |

### Cover

Covers should be configured with the appropriate `device_class`.

Covers with a `device_class` of `blind`, `shade`, `curtin` are shown as an Interior Blind in the Alexa App and Covers with a `window`, `awning`, or `shutter` will show as an Exterior Blind.

Covers with the `device_class` of `garage` are shown as a [Garage Door](#garage-doors) and support the Open by Voice PIN feature.

Use the [Entity Customization Tool](/docs/configuration/customizing-devices/#customization-using-the-ui) to override the `device_class` attribute to correctly expose a `cover` to Alexa.

#### Open/Close/Raise/Lower

Home Assistant configures covers with semantics that provide _"raise"_, _"lower"_, _"open"_, _"close"_ utterances for covers. In addition to semantics _"turn on"_ / _"turn off"_ utterances will also work.

- _"Alexa, open the garage door."_
- _"Alexa, close the curtain."_
- _"Alexa, lower the shades."_
- _"Alexa, raise the roof!"_

Semantics are assigned based on the features supported by the cover. If the cover supports tilt functionality, the semantics _"open"_ and _"close"_ are assigned to the tilt functionality, and the semantics _"raise"_ and _"lower"_ are assigned to the position functionality.

If the cover does not support tilt, all semantics _"raise"_, _"lower"_, _"open"_, _"close"_ are assigned to the position functionality.

#### Set Cover Position

Covers that support a set position can be controlled using percentages.

- _"Alexa, set the [entity name] position to thirty percent."_
- _"Alexa, increase [entity name] position by ten percent."_
- _"Alexa, decrease [entity name] position by twenty percent."_

| Locale  | Friendly Name Synonyms    |

## Debugging

The Alexa integration will log additional information about state updates and other messages when the log level is set to `debug`. Add the relevant line below to the `configuration.yaml`:

If using Alexa with an Alexa Smart Home Skill and Lambda function such as haaska:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.alexa: debug
```

If using Home Assistant Cloud you also need to debug `hass_nubucasa.iot`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.alexa: debug
    hass_nabucasa.iot: debug
```
