The sun {% term integration %} will use the location as
{% my general title="configured in your Home Assistant configuration" %} to
track if the sun is above or below the horizon. The sun can be used within
automations as
[a trigger with an optional offset to simulate dawn/dusk][sun_trigger] or as
[a condition with an optional offset to test if the sun has already set or risen][sun_condition].

[sun_trigger]: /docs/automation/trigger/#sun-trigger
[sun_condition]: /docs/scripts/conditions/#sun-condition

## Configured by default

This {% term integration %} is by default configured and installed, and you don't need
to configure it yourself, unless you've disabled or removed the
[`default_config:`](/integrations/default_config/) line from your
YAML configuration.

If that is the case, you can configure it as described in the next paragraphs.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## YAML configuration

Alternatively, this integration can be configured and set up manually via YAML
instead. To enable the sun integration in your installation, add the
following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sun:
```

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/screenshots/more-info-dialog-sun.png' />
</p>

## Automation trigger

The sun's event listener will call the service when the sun rises or sets with
an offset.

The sun trigger need to have the type 'sun', which event (sunset or sunrise) and an optional offset.

```yaml
trigger:
  - platform: sun
    event: sunrise
    offset: "-01:00:01"
```

| `offset` | An optional offset for the sun event trigger, in a positive or negative number of seconds, or specified in `HH:MM:SS` (after sun event trigger) or `-HH:MM:SS` (before sun event trigger). |

### Maintains entity `sun.sun`

| Possible state  | Description                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `above_horizon` | When the sun is above the horizon. |
| `below_horizon` | When the sun is below the horizon. |

## Sensors

The sensors are also available as attributes on the `sun.sun` entity for backwards compatibility reasons.
