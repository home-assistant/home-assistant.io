The AquaLogic integration provides connectivity to a Hayward/Goldline AquaLogic/ProLogic pool controller. Note that an RS-485 to Ethernet adapter connected to the pool controller is required.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)

## Configuration

To add the AquaLogic integration to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
aqualogic:
  host: IP_ADDRESS
  port: PORT
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The domain name or IP address of the RS-485 to Ethernet adapter connected to the pool controller, e.g., 192.168.1.1.
  required: true
  type: string
port:
  description: The port provided by the RS-485 to Ethernet adapter.
  required: true
  type: integer
{% endconfiguration %}

## Sensor

Once you have enabled the AquaLogic integration, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: aqualogic
    monitored_conditions:
      - pool_temp
```

{% configuration %}
monitored_conditions:
  description: List of items you want to monitor.
  required: false
  default: all
  type: list

      - lights
      - filter
```

{% configuration %}
monitored_conditions:
  description: List of items you want to monitor/control.
  required: false
  default: all
