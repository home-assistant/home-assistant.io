The Kaleidescape integration allows for the automation of [Kaleidescape](https://www.kaleidescape.com/) movie players.

Ideas for automation include:

- Playing and pausing a movie sets lighting scenes.
- The start of movie credits turns up the lights.
- A change in aspect ratio controls a projection masking system.
- A change in video resolution controls a lens system or video scaler.

## Supported Models

This integration is intended for the automation of Kaleidescape players with a movie zone. This includes all Strato and Premier players. Strato players support auto-discovery in Home Assistant. Premier players must be added manually by adding an instance of this integration and specifying the IP address of the player.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Media player

The Kaleidescape media player platform will create a [media player](/integrations/media_player/) entity for the device. This entity will display the currently playing media and playback controls.

## Remote

The Kaleidescape remote platform will create a [Remote](/integrations/remote/) entity for the device. This entity allows you to send the following commands via the [remote.send_command](/integrations/remote/) service.

- `select`
- `up`
- `down`
- `left`
- `right`
- `cancel`
- `replay`
- `scan_forward`
- `scan_reverse`
- `go_movie_covers`
- `menu_toggle`

A typical service call might look like the example below, which sends a command to the device to _select_ the currently highlighted item.

```yaml
service: remote.send_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.kaleidescape_theater
data:
  command:
    - select
```

## Sensor

The Kaleidescape sensor platform will create multiple [Sensor](/integrations/sensor/) entities for the device. The follow sensors are provided:

Additional details about the values provided by the sensors can be found in Kaleidescape's [Control Protocol Reference Manual](https://www.kaleidescape.com/wp-content/uploads/Kaleidescape-System-Control-Protocol-Reference-Manual.pdf).

A typical automation might look like the example below, which turns up the lights when the _media_location_ sensor leaves the _content_ state.

```yaml
- alias: kaleidescape_theater_lights_up
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.kaleidescape_theater_media_location
      from: content
  action:
    - service: scene.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: scene.theater_lights
```
