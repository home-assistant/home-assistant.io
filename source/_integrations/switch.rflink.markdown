The `rflink` integration supports devices that use [RFLink gateway firmware](https://www.rflink.nl/download.php), for example, the [Nodo RFLink Gateway](https://www.nodo-shop.nl/21-rflink-). RFLink gateway is an Arduino firmware that allows two-way communication with a multitude of RF wireless devices using cheap hardware (Arduino + transceiver).

First, you have to set up your [RFLink hub](/integrations/rflink/).

The RFLink integration does not know the difference between a `switch`, a `binary_sensor` and a `light`. Therefore all switchable devices are automatically added as `light` by default.

RFLink binary_sensor/switch/light ID's are composed of: protocol, id, switch/channel. For example: `newkaku_0000c6c2_1`.

Once the ID of a switch is known, it can be used to configure it as a switch type in HA and, for example, to add it to a different group or configure a nice name.

Configuring devices as switch :

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: rflink
    devices:
      newkaku_0000c6c2_1: {}
      conrad_00785c_0a: {}
```

## Switch state

Initially, the state of a switch is unknown. When the switch is turned on or off (via frontend or wireless remote) the state is known and will be shown in the frontend.

Sometimes a switch is controlled by multiple wireless remotes, each remote has its own code programmed in the switch. To allow tracking of the state when switched via other remotes add the corresponding remote codes as aliases:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: rflink
    devices:
      newkaku_0000c6c2_1:
        name: Ceiling fan
        aliases:
          - newkaku_000000001_2
          - kaku_000001_a
```

Any on/off command from any alias ID updates the current state of the switch. However, when sending a command through the frontend only the primary ID is used.

See [device support](/integrations/rflink/#device-support)

### Additional configuration examples

Multiple switches with signal repetitions and custom names

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: rflink
    device_defaults:
      fire_event: true
      signal_repetitions: 2
    devices:
      newkaku_0000c6c2_1:
        name: Ceiling fan
      conrad_00785c_0a:
        name: Motion sensor kitchen
```
