The Elk-M1 is a home security and automation controller that is capable of alarm control panel functions and automation.

The Elk-M1 controller is manufactured by [Elk Products](https://www.elkproducts.com).

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Alarm** - An ElkM1 area (also known as partition) is represented as an `alarm_control_panel`.
- **Binary sensor** - ElkM1 zones that have 4 states (i.e.: are not analog zones) are represented as `binary_sensor` entities. `Normal` is `off` and any of the other values is `on`.
- **Climate** - An ElkM1 thermostat is represented as a `climate` entity.
- **Light** - An ElkM1 light (which can be X10, Insteon, UPB) is represented as a `light`.
- **Scene** - ElkM1 tasks are represented as `scene` entities.
- **Sensor** - ElkM1 counters, keypads, panel, settings, and zones are represented as `sensor` entities.
- **Switch** - ElkM1 outputs are represented as `switch` entities.

The implementation follows the Elk Products ElkM1 "ASCII Protocol & Interface 
Specification, Revision 1.84" document. This document can be found on the Internet.

## ElkM1 configuration and version

In order for the ElkM1 integration to work to its fullest with Home Assistant the
ElkM1 panel must be configured correctly. This section describes the configuration
required on the ElkM1 panel.

### ElkM1 version

ElkM1 should be running:

- Version 4.6.8, or
- Version 5.2.0 or higher.

Force arm away and stay are available in 5.3.0 or higher.

Many features will work with lower versions of the ElkM1. Check the "ElkM1 RS232 Protocol" manual for details.

### ELK-M1XEP version

The ELK-M1XEP is the Ethernet controller board for the ElkM1. If connecting the integration
in secure mode the version of the ELK-M1XEP determines which secure protocol is supported.
ELK-M1XEP versions less than 2.0.46 support TLS 1.0, while version 2.0.46 and above support
TLS 1.2. When adding the ElkM1 integration in the user interface use `secure` for TLS 1.0 and
use `TLS 1.2` for TLS 1.2. Note that ELK-M1XEP does not support auto-negotiation of the 
version of the TLS protocol, the user must specify the TLS version to connect.

### Global Setting 35

The ElkM1 integration tracks the user number and name of the last user name to
arm or disarm the panel. The `changed_by` and `changed_by_id` attributes of
the `alarm_control_panel` hold those two attributes.

On the ElkM1 panel Global Setting 35, "Transmit Event Log" must be
enabled for this to fully work.

Note that without Global Setting 35 set and in a single area system,
`changed_by` and `changed_by_id` are updated when a user enters a valid
code on a physical keypad.

### Global Setting 36 â€” 40

If you are using the features below then these respective global options
should be enabled:

| Option # | Option Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 36       | Transmit Zone Changes            | If you are using Zones this allows Home Assistant to track the status of the Zones.                                                                                                                                                |
| 37       | Transmit Output Changes          | If you are using Outputs this allows Home Assistant to track the status of the Outputs.                                                                                                                                            |
| 38       | Transmit Automation Task Changes | If you are using ElkM1 Tasks this allows Home Assistant to track the status of the Tasks.                                                                                                                                          |
| 39       | Transmit Light Changes           | If you are using ElkM1 Lights this allows Home Assistant to track the status of the lights.                                                                                                                                        |
| 40       | Transmit Keypad Changes          | Oddly, this option tracks keypad changes and alarm status. If you are wishing to track keypresses on ElkM1 keypad or if you are wishing to track the armed, disarmed, and alarm state of the ElkM1 then this option should be set. |

## System Trouble Status

The ElkM1 is able to report general system trouble statuses. This is
reported using the `system_trouble_status` attribute of the
panel sensor (often named `sensor.elkm1`) in Home Assistant.

The format of the `system_trouble_status` attribute is a comma separated list
of the active troubles. Only active trouble statuses are in the list.
If the trouble is for a zone then `zone <number>` is appended to the trouble name.

For example, if zone 42 wireless sensor lost communication with the panel then
`system_trouble_status` would be "Lost Transmitter zone 42". If in addition there
was an AC failure then `system_trouble_status` would be the string
"AC Fail, Lost Transmitter zone 42".

The complete list of trouble statuses are:

- AC Fail
- Box Tamper (zone is part of status)
- Fail To Communicate
- EEProm Memory Error
- Low Battery Control
- Transmitter Low Battery (zone is part of status)
- Over Current
- Telephone Fault
- Output 2
- Missing Keypad
- Zone Expander
- Output Expander
- ELKRP Remote Access
- Common Area Not Armed
- Flash Memory Error
- Security Alert (zone is part of status)
- Serial Port Expander
- Lost Transmitter (zone is part of status)
- GE Smoke CleanMe
- Ethernet
- Display Message In Keypad Line 1
- Display Message In Keypad Line 2
- Fire (zone is part of status)

## Manual configuration

Alternatively, configuration through the `configuration.yaml` file
is supported (example below).

Both methods of configuration support "auto configuration". This works by
reporting only elements on the ElkM1 that have a "Name" configured.
So, for example, if counter #11 on the panel was configured with
the name "Test counter" then this element would show up in Home Assistant. If
an element is being used but does not have a name configured then
it will not appear in Home Assistant through the auto-configuration feature.

Example configuration of the above:

```yaml
elkm1:
  host: elks://IP_ADDRESS
  username: USERNAME
  password: PASSWORD
  area:
    exclude: [5-8]
  zone:
    exclude: [11-16, 19-192, 199-208]
  plc:
    include: [a1-d16, 192]
    exclude: [b12-d5]
```

Example configuration using `auto_configure`:

```yaml
elkm1:
  host: elks://IP_ADDRESS
  username: USERNAME
  password: PASSWORD
  auto_configure: true
```

Example for a serial port instance on /dev/ttyUSB0 at 115200 baud:

```yaml
elkm1:
  - host: serial:///dev/ttyUSB0:115200
    # Elk doesn't know which areas/zones/etc are unused, so it can generate
    # many unwanted Home Assistant Entities.  Be liberal in excluding them:
    area:
      exclude: [2-8]
    zone:
      exclude: [17-192, 195-208]
    plc:
      enabled: false
    task:
      enabled: false
    counter:
      exclude: [1-64]
    keypad:
      exclude: [3-16]
    setting:
      exclude: [1-20]
    output:
      enabled: false
    thermostat:
      enabled: false
```

## Events

The ElkM1 integration supports the following event: `elkm1.keypad_key_pressed`.
The event is generated whenever a key is pressed on an ElkM1 keypad.
The `event_data` contains the following:

- `keypad_id`: The number of the keypad that reported the keypress.
- `key_name`: The name of the key that was pressed.
- `key`: The number of the key that was pressed.

## Debugging
Debug logs are often required to solve an issue. Follow the instructions on [Enabling debug logging](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#enabling-debug-logging).

Sometimes, for example, a problem can occur while starting Home Assistant. In this case, follow these instructions.
Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file in your Home Assistant `config` directory:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    elkm1_lib: debug
    homeassistant.components.elkm1: debug
```

After updating your configuration file, restart Home Assistant. The debug logs will be in the file `homeassistant.log` in the `config` directory.
