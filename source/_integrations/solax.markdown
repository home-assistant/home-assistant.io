The `solax` integration connects Home Assistant to Solax solar power inverters. Solax inverters may be connected to a home Wi-Fi network and expose a REST API. This integration retrieves information such as photovoltaic power production, battery levels and power, and how much power is being fed back into the grid.

### Optional template sensor

If you would like to convert the values from multiple panels or view the total power the house is using, you can use the [template platform](/integrations/template).

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for template platform
template:
- sensor
  - name: Total PV power
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    state: "{{ (states('sensor.pv1_power') | float(default=0)) + (states('sensor.pv2_power') | float(default=0)) }}"
  - name: Load power
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
    state: "{{ (states('sensor.power_now') | float(default=0)) - (states('sensor.exported_power') | float(default=0)) }}"
```

{% endraw %}

### Configuring the Energy Dashboard

There are generally at least 3 sensors from your inverter that you need to configure in the energy dashboard:

- The consumption sensor (in kWh) for the **Grid Consumption**.
- The feed-in sensor (in kWh) for the **Return to grid**, for example, the solar panel energy you do not consume and return to the grid instead.
- The on-grid yield sensor (in kWh) for the **Solar production**.

### Note

Inverter models with newer firmware (and also those using devices like PocketWifi) no longer expose an API when connected to your wireless network, they do however continue to expose it on their own broadcasted SSID. To use this sensor in this case it is necessary to set up a reverse proxy with something like NGINX and use a Raspberry Pi (or similar) with two network connections (one being Wi-Fi that connects to the inverters SSID).


Example NGINX configuration

```text
location / {
  proxy_pass http://5.8.8.8;
}
```
