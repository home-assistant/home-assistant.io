AquaCell is a water-softening device. The **AquaCell** {% term integration %} allows you to monitor your AquaCell device in Home Assistant.
You will need your Aquacell account information as used in the **AquaCell** app.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

<div class='note warning'>
This integration only works with <b>AquaCell</b> devices which have an <b>i-Lid</b> and are configured through the 'Mijn AquaCell' mobile app.
</div>

## Sensors

This integration provides {% term sensors %} for the following information from the AquaCell device:

- Percentage of salt remaining.
- Time remaining until 0% salt level is reached.
- iLid battery level.
- Wi-Fi signal strength.

<div class="note">
The device does not update frequently, the integration polls the information once a day from the cloud.
