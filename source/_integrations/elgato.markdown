The [Elgato](https://www.elgato.com/) Lights sets the bar for high-end studio
lightning. The LED lights are created and designed specifically for streamers
and content creators, many of whom operate on platforms like YouTube and Twitch.

The following light productions from Elgato have been tested with this
integration:

- [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)
- [Elgato Key Light Air](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-air)
- [Elgato Key Light Mini](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-mini)
- [Elgato Ring Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/ring-light)
- [Elgato Light Strip](https://www.elgato.com/en/light-strip)

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Lights

This integration adds the Key Light device as a light in Home Assistant, and
allows you to control the color temperature, brightness, and its on/off state.

When using the Elgato Light Strip, color support is automatically detected
and enabled in Home Assistant.

## Other entities

Besides the above mentioned light entity, this integration also provides other
secondary entities that can be useful for monitoring and controlling your
Elgato light.

### Sensors

If you have a Key Light Mini, Home Assistant will provide an additional
sensor that indicates the level of your battery in percent (%).

### Switches

If you have a Key Light Mini, Home Assistant will provide an additional
switch that allows the control of the "Studio mode" of your light. When
studio mode is enabled, your battery will not be used and bypassed.

## Services

### Service `elgato.identify`

The identify service shortly blinks the Elgato light. Originally meant as
a way to identify which light you are talking to; it can also be used as
a service to create a visual notification.

This service also works when the light is turned off and will turn off the
light after the identification sequence has been completed.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | Yes | String or list of Elgato light entity IDs.

Example automation, in YAML format, that triggers a visual notification when
a binary sensor (a doorbell) is triggered:

```yaml
- alias: Visual doorbell notification example
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: elgato.identify
      target:
        entity_id: light.elgato_key_light
```
