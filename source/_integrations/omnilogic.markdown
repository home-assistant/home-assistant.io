## Known limitations

- The platform only supports sensors and switches at the current release. Future releases will include light/water heater for control of Colorlogic lights and pool heaters.

## Debugging integration

If you have problems with the integration you can add debug prints to the log to aid in troubleshooting.

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    omnilogic: debug
    homeassistant.components.omnilogic: debug
