The **IBM Watson IoT Platform** {% term integration %} enables you to link the devices in Home Assistant
with an [IBM Watson IoT Platform instance](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/internet-of-things-cloud).

## Configuration

To use this {% term integration %}, you first need to register a gateway device type and then
a gateway device in your IoT platform instance. For instructions on how to do
this check the [official documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/IoT?topic=iot-platform-getting-started#IoT_connectGateway)
which provides the details on doing this. After you register the gateway device
for your Home Assistant instance you'll need four pieces of information:

- Organization ID
- Gateway device Type
- Gateway device ID
- Authentication Token

With this basic information you can add the {% term integration %} to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry:
watson_iot:
  organization: "organization_id"
  type: "device_type"
  id: "device_id"
  token: "auth_token"
```
