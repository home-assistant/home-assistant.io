The `watson_iot` integration enables you to link the devices in Home Assistant
with an [IBM Watson IoT Platform instance](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/internet-of-things-cloud).

## Configuration

To use this component, you first need to register a gateway device type and then
a gateway device in your IoT platform instance. For instructions on how to do
this check the [official documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/IoT?topic=iot-platform-getting-started#IoT_connectGateway)
which provides the details on doing this. After you register the gateway device
for your Home Assistant instance you'll need four pieces of information:

- Organization ID
- Gateway device Type
- Gateway device ID
- Authentication Token

With this basic information you can configure the component:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry:
watson_iot:
  organization: "organization_id"
  type: "device_type"
  id: "device_id"
  token: "auth_token"
```

{% configuration %}
organization:
  description: The Organization ID for your Watson IoT Platform instance.
  required: true
  type: string
type:
  description: The device type for the gateway device to use.
  required: true
  type: string
id:
  description: The device id for the gateway device to use.
  required: true
  type: string
token:
  description: The authentication token for the gateway device.
  required: true
  type: string
exclude:
  description: Configure which integrations should be excluded from recording to Watson IoT Platform.
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    entities:
      description: The list of entity ids to be excluded from recording to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
    domains:
      description: The list of domains to be excluded from recording to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
include:
  description: Configure which integrations should be included in recordings to Watson IoT Platform. If set, all other entities will not be recorded to Watson IoT Platform. Values set by the **exclude** option will prevail.
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    entities:
      description: The list of entity ids to be included from recordings to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
    domains:
      description: The list of domains to be included from recordings to Watson IoT Platform.
      required: false
      type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## Examples

### Full configuration

```yaml
