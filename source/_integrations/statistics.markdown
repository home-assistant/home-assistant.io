The `statistics` integration observes the state of a source sensor and provides aggregated statistical characteristics about its recent past. This integration can be useful in automation, for example, to trigger an action when the air humidity in the bathroom settles after a hot shower or when the number of brewed coffees over a day gets too high.

The statistics sensor updates with every update of the source sensor, for which the numeric `sensor` and `binary_sensor` are supported. The time period and/or number of recent state changes, which should be considered, must be given in configuration. Check the configuration section below for details.

Assuming the [`recorder`](/integrations/recorder/) integration is running, historical sensor data is read from the database on startup and is available immediately after a restart of the platform. If the [`recorder`](/integrations/recorder/) integration is *not* running, it can take some time for the sensor to start reporting data because some characteristics calculations require more than one source sensor value.

{% tip %}
The `statistics` integration is different to [Long-term Statistics](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/#long-term-statistics). More details on the differences can be found in the [2021.8.0 release notes](/blog/2021/08/04/release-20218/#long-term-statistics).

## Characteristics

The following options for the configuration parameter `state_characteristic` are available as staticical characteristics. Pay close attention to the correct configuration of `sampling_size` and/or `max_age`, as most characteristics are directly influenced by these settings.

### Numeric Source Sensor

The following are supported for `sensor` source sensors `state_characteristic`:

| State Characteristic | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `average_linear` | The average value of stored measurements under consideration of the time distances between them. A linear interpolation is applied per measurement pair. Good suited to observe a source sensor with non-periodic sensor updates and when continuous behavior is represented by the measurements (e.g. outside temperature).
| `average_step` | The average value of stored measurements under consideration of the time distances between them. LOCF (last observation carried forward weighting) is applied, meaning, that the old value is assumed between two measurements. The resulting step function represents well the behavior of non-continuous behavior, like the set temperature of a boiler.
| `average_timeless` | The average value of stored measurements. This method assumes that all measurements are equally spaced and, therefore, time is ignored and a simple average of values is computed. Equal to `mean`.
| `change_sample` | The average change per sample. The difference between the newest and the oldest measurement is divided by the number of in-between measurements (n-1).
| `change_second` | The average change per second. The difference between the newest and the oldest measurement is divided by seconds between them.
| `change` | The difference between the newest and the oldest measurement.
| `count` | The number of stored source sensor readings. This number is limited by `sampling_size` and can be low within the bounds of `max_age`.
| `datetime_newest` | The timestamp of the newest measurement.
| `datetime_oldest` | The timestamp of the oldest measurement.
| `datetime_value_max` | The timestamp of the numerically biggest measurement.
| `datetime_value_min` | The timestamp of the numerically smallest measurement.
| `distance_95_percent_of_values` | A statistical indicator derived from the standard deviation of an assumed normal distribution. 95% of all stored values fall into a range of returned size.
| `distance_99_percent_of_values` | A statistical indicator derived from the standard deviation of an assumed normal distribution. 99% of all stored values fall into a range of returned size.
| `distance_absolute` | The difference or "spread" between the extreme values of measurements. Equals `value_max` minus `value_min`.
| `mean` | The average value computed for all measurements. Be aware that this does not take into account uneven time intervals between measurements.
| `mean_circular` | The [circular mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_mean) for angular measurements (_e.g._ wind direction). Assumes that measurements are expressed in degrees (_e.g._, 180° or -90°), and outputs the mean in positive degrees (0-360°).
| `median` | The [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)#Comparison_of_mean,_median_and_mode) value computed for all measurements.
| `noisiness` | A simplified version of a signal-to-noise ratio. A high value indicates a quickly changing source sensor value, a small value will be seen for a steady source sensor. The absolute change between subsequent source sensor measurement values is summed up and divided by the number of intervals.
| `percentile` | [Percentiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) divide the range of a distribution of all considered source sensor measurements into 100 continuous intervals of equal probability. The characteristic calculates the value for which a given percentage of source sensor measurements are smaller in value. The 20th percentile is the value below which 20 percent of the measurements may be found. The additional configuration parameters `percentile` is needed, see below.
| `standard_deviation` | The [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of an assumed normal distribution from all measurements.
| `sum` | The mathematical sum of all source sensor measurement values within the given time and sampling size limits.
| `sum_differences` | The mathematical sum of differences between subsequent source sensor measurement values within the given time and sampling size limits.
| `sum_differences_nonnegative` | The mathematical sum of non-negative differences between subsequent source sensor measurement values within the given time and sampling size limits. The characteristic assumes that the source sensor value can only increase, but might occasionally be reset to zero. If a value is smaller than the previous value, the function assumes the previous value should have been a zero.
| `total` | The mathematical sum of all source sensor measurement values within the given time and sampling size limits. Equal to `sum`.
| `value_max` | The biggest value among the number of measurements.
| `value_min` | The smallest value among the number of measurements.
| `variance` | The [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of an assumed normal distribution from all measurements.

### Binary Source Sensor

The following are supported for `binary_sensor` source sensors `state_characteristic`:

| State Characteristic | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `average_step` | A percentage of time across all stored measurements, in which the binary source sensor was "On". If over the course of one hour, movement was detected for 6 minutes, the `average_step` is 10%.
| `average_timeless` | The percentage of stored measurements, for which the binary source sensor was "On". Time in on/off states is ignored. If over the course of one hour, a single movement was detected, the `average_timeless` is 33.3% (assuming the stored measurements "Off", "On", "Off"). Equal to `mean`.
| `count` | The number of stored source sensor readings.
| `count_on` | The number of stored source sensor readings with the value "On". Be aware that only value changes are registered by default, except if the source sensor has the property `force_update` set to true.
| `count_off` | The number of stored source sensor readings with the value "Off". Be aware that only value changes are registered by default, except if the source sensor has the property `force_update` set to true.
| `datetime_newest` | The timestamp of the newest measurement.
| `datetime_oldest` | The timestamp of the oldest measurement.
| `mean` | The percentage of stored measurements, for which the binary source sensor was "On". Time in on/off states is ignored. If over the course of one hour, a single movement was detected, the `average_timeless` is 33.3% (assuming the stored measurements "Off", "On", "Off").

## Attributes

A statistics sensor presents the following attributes for context about its internal status.

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `age_coverage_ratio` | Only when `max_age` is defined. Ratio (0.0-1.0) of the configured age of source sensor measurements considered (time period `max_age`) covered in-between the oldest and newest stored values. A low number can indicate an unwanted mismatch between the configured limits and the source sensor behavior. The value 1.0 represents at least two values covering the full time period. Value 0 is the result of only one measurement considered. The sensor turns `Unknown` if no measurements are stored.
| `buffer_usage_ratio` | Only when `sampling_size` is defined. Ratio (0.0-1.0) of the configured buffer size used by the stored source sensor measurements. A low number can indicate an unwanted mismatch between the configured limits and the source sensor behavior. The value 1.0 represents a full buffer, value 0 stands for an empty one.
| `source_value_valid` | True/false indication whether the source sensor supplies valid values to the statistics sensor (judged by the last value received).

## YAML configuration

Define a statistics sensor by adding lines similar to the following examples to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: statistics
    name: "Bathroom humidity mean over last 24 hours"
    entity_id: sensor.bathroom_humidity
    state_characteristic: mean
    max_age:
      hours: 24

  - platform: statistics
    entity_id: binary_sensor.movement
    state_characteristic: count_on
    sampling_size: 100

  - platform: statistics
    name: "Bathroom humidity change over 5 minutes"
    entity_id: sensor.bathroom_humidity
    state_characteristic: change
    max_age:
      minutes: 5
    sampling_size: 50
    precision: 1
```

{% endconfiguration %}

### An important note on `max_age` and `sampling_size`

If both `max_age` and `sampling_size` are given, the considered samples are those within the `max_age` time window but limited to the number of `sampling_size` newest samples.  Specify a wide-enough `sampling_size` if using an extended `max_age` (e.g., when looking for `max_age` 1 hour, a sensor that produces one measurement per minute should have at least a `sampling_size` of 60 to use all samples within the `max_age` timeframe.)

If only `sampling_size` is given there is no time limit. If only `max_age` is given the considered number of samples is unlimited.
