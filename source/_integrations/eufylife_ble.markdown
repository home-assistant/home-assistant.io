## Features

All smart scale models provide a weight sensor entity and a real-time weight sensor entity. The real-time weight entity updates in real time while the scale is taking a weight measurement. The weight entity updates with the final weight value only when the scale is finished taking a weight measurement.

The Smart Scale P2 Pro additionally provides a heart rate sensor entity that will display the most recent heart rate measurement taken by the scale.

The EufyLife integration will automatically discover devices once the [Bluetooth](/integrations/bluetooth) integration is enabled and functional. Alternatively, follow the steps below to add the integration manually.
