The **DHCP discovery** {% term integration %} will watch the network for DHCP requests for supported devices and services. Discovered integrations will show up in the discovered section on the integrations page in the configuration panel.

## Configuration

This {% term integration %} is by default enabled, unless you've disabled or removed the [`default_config:`](/integrations/default_config/) line from your configuration. If that is the case, the following example shows you how to enable this integration manually:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
dhcp:
```
