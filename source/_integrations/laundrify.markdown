Monitor the status of your washing machine or dryer within Home Assistant using a [laundrify](https://laundrify.de/) WiFi power plug.

The following platforms/entities are currently supported by the integration:

- Binary sensor
  - Wash Cycle (_running_/_not running_)
- Sensor
  - Power (latest measurement in _Watts_)
  - Energy (total consumption in _kWh_)

## Generate an Auth Code

*Please note that the laundrify App v1.12.0 is required to activate the Home Assistant integration.*

The integration requires an Auth Code to complete the account linking. Open the laundrify App and tap on `Home Assistant -> Integration aktivieren` to generate your code.
