This platform allows you to connect to a [Ruckus Unleashed](https://support.ruckuswireless.com/product_families/19-ruckus-unleashed) access point.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Presence detection** - The platform will look at devices connected to the access point and will create a `device_tracker` for each discovered device.

## Configuration

To add a Ruckus Unleashed device to your installation, go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**, click the `+` button, then select **Ruckus** from the list of integrations.

It is required to configure the IP address of your **master access point**. See the section Access Points on the management web interface. And perhaps consider to set a preferred master (Admin & Services>System>System Info>Preferred master).

You will have to create a user on the device which is a **Monitoring Admin**. Login to the Ruckus Unleashed admin UI and follow these steps:

 - [Create a new role](https://docs.ruckuswireless.com/unleashed/200.1.9.12/t-ConfigUserRoles.html).
   - Check **Allow Unleashed Administration**.
   - Select the **Monitoring Admin (Monitoring and viewing operation status only)** radio button. 
 - [Create a new user](https://docs.ruckuswireless.com/unleashed/200.1.9.12/t-AddingNewUsersInternal.html) with the new role.

## Troubleshooting

For this platform to work, the Ruckus Unleashed device will need to be accessible over SSH. If you are having trouble with Home Assistant not connecting, make sure the user you created above can log in to SSH and can run privileged commands.

Terminal:

```bash
ssh <ruckus_ip>

Please login: <username>
Password: <password>
Welcome to Ruckus Unleashed Network Command Line Interface
ruckus> enable
ruckus# exit
Exit ruckus CLI.
```
