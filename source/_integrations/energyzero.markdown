The EnergyZero integration integrates the [EnergyZero](https://www.energyzero.nl/) API platform with Home Assistant.

The integration makes it possible to retrieve the dynamic energy/gas prices
from EnergyZero in order to gain insight into the price trend of the day and
to adjust your consumption accordingly.

## Sensors

The EnergyZero integration creates a number of sensor entities for both gas and electricity prices.

### Energy market price

Every day around **14:00 UTC time**, the new prices are published for the following day.

- The `current` and `next hour` electricity market price
- Average electricity price of the day
- Lowest energy price
- Highest energy price
- Time of day when the price is highest
- Time of day when the price is at its lowest
- Percentage of the current price compared to the maximum price

### Gas market price

For the dynamic gas prices, only entities are created that display the
`current` and `next hour` price because the price is always fixed for
24 hours; new prices are published every morning at **05:00 UTC time**.

## Actions

The energy and gas prices are exposed using [actions](/docs/scripts/perform-actions/). The actions populate [Response Data](/docs/scripts/perform-actions#use-templates-to-handle-response-data) with price data.

### Action `energyzero.get_gas_prices`

Fetches the gas prices. The `config_entry` value be found using the **Actions** tab in the **Developer Tools**, selecting the desired entity and then switching to YAML.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                          | Example                          |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `config_entry` | no       | Config entry to use.                                 | 1b4a46c6cba0677bbfb5a8c53e8618b0 |
| `incl_vat`     | no       | Defines whether the prices include or exclude VAT.   | false                            |
| `start`        | yes      | Start time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00 | 2023-01-01 00:00:00              |
| `end`          | yes      | End time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00   | 2023-01-01 00:00:00              |

### Response data

The response data is a dictionary with the gas timestamps and prices as string and float values.

{% raw %}

```json
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-09-25 03:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 1.1
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-09-25 04:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 1.05
    }
  ]
}

```

{% endraw %}

### Action `energyzero.get_energy_prices`

Fetches the energy prices. The `config_entry` value be found using the **Actions** tab in the **Developer Tools**, selecting the desired entity and then switching to YAML.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                   | Example                          |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `config_entry` | no       | Config entry to use. Can be found using the **Actions** tab in the **Developer Tools** and switching to YAML. | 1b4a46c6cba0677bbfb5a8c53e8618b0 |
| `incl_vat`     | no       | Defines whether the prices include or exclude VAT.                                                            | false                            |
| `start`        | yes      | Start time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00                                                          | 2023-01-01 00:00:00              |
| `end`          | yes      | End time to get prices. Defaults to today 00:00:00                                                            | 2023-01-01 00:00:00              |

### Response data

The response data is a dictionary with the energy timestamps and prices as string and float values.

{% raw %}

```json
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-09-25 03:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.05
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2023-09-25 04:00:00+00:00",
      "price": 0.12
    }
  ]
}
```

{% endraw %}

### Add response to sensor

The response data can be added to a template sensor:

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: time_pattern
        hours: "*"
    action:
      - action: energyzero.get_energy_prices
        response_variable: prices
        data:
          config_entry: 1b4a46c6cba0677bbfb5a8c53e8618b0
          incl_vat: false
    sensor:
      - name: Energy prices
        device_class: timestamp
        state: "{{ now() }}"
        attributes:
          prices: '{{ prices }}'
```

{% endraw %}
