[SimpleFIN](http://simplefin.org) allows users to share read-only financial data. This is a paid service although it is quite affordable ($1.50 a month).

## Setup Guide

Within the SimpleFIN Interface, you can create a **Claim Token**, a one-time token that can be exchanged for an **Access URL**. You can enter either a **Claim Token** or an **Access URL** as a configuration element for this integration. 

### Accounts & Devices

Each financial institution you setup will configured as a **Device** within Home Assistant. And any associated accounts will be linked to these devices.
