  - Using the Refoss app (download and install the Refoss app on Google Play) to connect devices to the local network.
  - Using the Web page to connect devices to the local network.
    - The computer/mobile phone is connected to the device factory Wi-Fi.
    - In the browser, access the address 10.10.10.1, then select the local Wi-Fi needed for device configuration.
- The integration will occupy port: 9989.

### Supported device model

- Refoss Smart Wi-Fi Switch, R10
  
### Discover device

## Entity naming

The integration uses the following strategy to name its entities:

-  The entity name will be generated by `Device Name` and `Channel Number`.

Single channel device.

Examples:

| Device Name |Channel Number| Entity Name |              
| ----------- | -----------|------------|
| `r10`       | `0`           | r10        |

Multi-channel device.
  
Examples:

| Device Name | Channel Number | Entity Name |              
| ----------- |----------------|----------|
| `r10`       | `0`            | r10      |
| `r10`       | `1`            | r10-1    |
