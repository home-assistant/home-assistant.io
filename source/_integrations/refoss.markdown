Integrate Refoss devices into Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

- The device needs to be connected to the local network first. There are two ways to connect devices to the local network:
  - Using the Refoss app (download and install the Refoss app on Google Play) to connect devices to the local network.
  - Using the Web page to connect devices to the local network.
    - The computer/mobile phone is connected to the device factory Wi-Fi.
    - In the browser, access the address 10.10.10.1, then select the local Wi-Fi needed for device configuration.
- The integration will occupy port: 9989.

### Discover device

  - After integrating Refoss, it will start socket broadcast and Home Assistant will automatically discover Refoss devices under the current LAN.
  
## Entity naming

The integration uses the following strategy to name its entities:

-  The entity name will be generated by `Device Name` and `Channel Number`.

Single channel device.

Examples:

| Device Name |Channel Number| Entity Name |              
| ----------- | -----------|------------|
| `r10`       | `0`           | r10        |

Multi-channel device.
  
Examples:

| Device Name | Channel Number | Entity Name |              
| ----------- |----------------|----------|
| `r10`       | `0`            | r10      |
| `r10`       | `1`            | r10-1    |
