The `tile` platform allows Home Assistant to utilize [Tile® Bluetooth trackers](https://www.thetileapp.com).
The official Tile mobile app handles the actual tracking of Tile devices using
the mobile device's Bluetooth and GPS.

This integration can be configured via the Home Assistant UI by navigating to
**Configuration** -> **Integrations**.
