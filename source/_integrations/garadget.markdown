The `garadget` cover platform lets you control [Garadget](https://www.garadget.com/) garage door futurizers through Home Assistant.

## Configuration

To enable Garadget Covers in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry

  - platform: garadget
    covers:
      first_garage:

{% endraw %}

Some of the Garadget sensors can create a lot of clutter in the logbook.  Use this section of code in your `configuration.yaml` to exclude those entries.

```yaml
logbook:
  exclude:
    entities:
      - sensor.garage_door_time_in_state
      - sensor.garage_door_wifi_signal_strength
```

As of firmware release 1.17 the garadget device has native support for MQTT. The options allow the end-user to configure the device in the following ways 'cloud only', 'cloud and MQTT' or 'MQTT only'.

For configuration of the garadget as a MQTT cover:

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Garage Door"
    command_topic: "garadget/device_name/command"
    state_topic: "garadget/device_name/status"
    payload_open: "open"
    payload_close: "close"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.status }}"
```

Replace device_name with the name of the device provided when configuring garadget.
