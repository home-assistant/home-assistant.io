Some of the Garadget sensors can create a lot of clutter in the logbook.  Use this section of code in your `configuration.yaml` to exclude those entries.

```yaml
logbook:
  exclude:
    entities:
      - sensor.garage_door_time_in_state
      - sensor.garage_door_wifi_signal_strength
```

As of firmware release 1.17 the garadget device has native support for MQTT. The options allow the end-user to configure the device in the following ways 'cloud only', 'cloud and MQTT' or 'MQTT only'.

For configuration of the garadget as a MQTT cover:

```yaml
mqtt:
  cover:
    - name: "Garage Door"
      command_topic: "garadget/device_name/command"
      state_topic: "garadget/device_name/status"
      payload_open: "open"
      payload_close: "close"
      payload_stop: "stop"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.status }}"
  sensor:
    - name: "Garage Door Since"
      state_topic: "garadget/device_name/status"
      value_template: '{{ value_json.time }}'

    - name: "Large Garage Door Brightness"
      state_topic: "garadget/device_name/status"
      unit_of_measurement: '%'
      value_template: '{{ value_json.bright }}'

```

Replace device_name with the name of the device provided when configuring garadget.
