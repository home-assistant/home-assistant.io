The [GreenEye Monitor (GEM)](https://www.brultech.com/greeneye/) integration for Home Assistant allows you to create sensors for the various data channels of the GEM. Each current transformer (CT) channel, pulse counter, and temperature sensor appears in Home Assistant as a sensor, and can be used in automations.

Configure your GEM(s) to produce binary-format packets (for example, "Bin32 NET" for a 32-channel GEM with some channels configured for net metering) and send them to an unused port on your Home Assistant machine. (These settings are in the "Packet Send" and "Network" pages of the GEM UI.) Then specify that port and information about your monitor(s) and the data channels you wish to monitor in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
greeneye_monitor:
  port: 8000
  monitors:
    - serial_number: "YOUR_SERIAL_NUMBER"
      channels:
        - number: 1
          name: total_power
        - number: 2
          name: solar_panels_power
          net_metering: true
      pulse_counters:
        - number: 1
          name: sprinklers_water_usage
          counted_quantity: "gal"
          counted_quantity_per_pulse: 1
          time_unit: "min"
      temperature_sensors:
        temperature_unit: "C"
        sensors:
          - number: 1
            name: back_porch_temperature
      voltage:
        - number: 1
          name: house_volts
```

By default, GEM will send updates every 5 seconds. That's a lot of data, and the databases used by the [`recorder`](/integrations/recorder) integration for history don't do well with that much data, so it is recommended to configure the [`influxdb`](/integrations/influxdb) integration and exclude the GEM sensors from `recorder`.
