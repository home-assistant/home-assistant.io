The Renault integration offers integration with the **MyRenault** cloud service and provides sensors such as charger state and temperature.

This integration provides the following platforms:

- Binary sensors - such as plug and charge status.
- Device tracker - to track location of your car.
- Buttons - to start air conditioning or start/stop the charge. Please note that although available these actions do not work on all vehicles.
- Selectors - to change the charge mode.
- Sensors - such as battery level, outside temperature, odometer, estimated range, and charging rate.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

All vehicles linked to the account should then get added as devices, with sensors added as linked entity.
