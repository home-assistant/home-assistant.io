The `push` camera {% term integration %} allows you to integrate images sent over HTTP POST to Home Assistant as a camera. External applications/daemons/scripts are therefore able to "stream" images through Home Assistant.

Optionally the Push Camera can **buffer** a given number of images, creating an animation of the detected motion after the event has been recorded.

Images are cleared on new events, and events are separated by a soft (configurable) **timeout**.

## Integration with motionEye

The `push` camera can as an example be used with [motionEye](https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneye/wiki) a web frontend for the motion daemon. motionEye is usually configured to save/record files ***only*** when motion is detected. It provides a hook to run a command whenever an image is saved, which can be used together with cURL to send the motion detected images to the `push` camera, as shown in this example:

In motionEye, under **File Storage -> Run A Command** type in:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "image=@%f" http://my.hass.server.com:8123/api/webhook/my_custom_webhook_id
# inserting a backslash in the middle of "webhook" stops Motion to move the command to a webhook
```

Optionally configure motionEye to save only motion triggered images by going into **Still Images -> Capture Mode** and setting **Motion Triggered**. Tune your preferences under **Motion Detection**.

In this setup, you can configure the push camera to continuously replay the last motion triggered event using a configuration such as:

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: push
    name: MotionEye Outdoor
    buffer: 3
    timeout: 5
    webhook_id: my_custom_webhook_id
```

## Configuration

To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: push
    name: My Push Camera
    webhook_id: my_custom_webhook_id
```

{% configuration %}
