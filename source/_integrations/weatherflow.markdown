The **WeatherFlow** {% term integration %} is a local-only {% term integration %} that reads weather data from all [WeatherFlow Tempest](https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/) compatible weather station on the local network.

<div class='note'>
You may see slight deviations between the values reported in Home Assistant and the values in the WeatherFlow App. This is because the WeatherFlow app considers both forecasts and neighboring weather stations in addition to the local data used in this {% term integration %}.
