With the `no_ip` {% term integration %} you can keep your current IP address in sync with your [NO-IP.com](https://www.noip.com)  hostname or domain.  

Note that it does not confirm your hostname (as is required periodically for free domain names); you will still need to do that manually.

To use the {% term integration %} in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
no_ip:
  domain: subdomain.domain.com
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
  domain:
    description: Your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
    required: true
    type: string
  username:
