The **Calendar** {% term integration %} provides calendar {% term entities %}, allowing other integrations
to integrate calendars into Home Assistant. Calendars are shown on the calendar
dashboard and can be used with automations.

This page does not provide instructions on how to create calendar
entities. Please see the ["Calendar" category](/integrations/#calendar) on the
integrations page to find integrations offering calendar entities. For example, [Local Calendar](/integrations/local_calendar/) is a fully local integration to create calendars and events within your Home Assistant instance or other integrations work with other services providing calendar data.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}


## Viewing and managing calendars

Each calendar is represented as its own {% term entity %} in Home Assistant and can be
viewed and managed on a calendar dashboard. You can find the calendar dashboard
in the main sidebar of your Home Assistant instance.

Some calendar integrations allow Home Assistant to manage your calendars
directly from Home Assistant. In this case, you can add new events by selecting
the **Add event** button in the lower right corner of the calendar dashboard.

Also see [Services](#services) below.

## Automation

Calendar [Triggers](/docs/automation/trigger) enable {% term automation %} based on an
event's start or end. Review the [Automating Home Assistant](/getting-started/automation/)
getting started guide on automations or the [Automation](/docs/automation/)
documentation for full details.

Calendar {% term triggers %} are the best way to automate based on calendar events.
A calendar {% term entity %} can also be used to automate based on its state, but these are limited and attributes only represent the next event.

![Screenshot Trigger](/images/integrations/calendar/trigger.png)

An example of a calendar {% term trigger %} in YAML:

```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
    - platform: calendar
      # Possible values: start, end
      event: start
      # The calendar entity_id
      entity_id: calendar.personal
      # Optional time offset to fire a set time before or after event start/end
      offset: -00:15:00
```

Calendar triggers should not generally use automation mode `single` to ensure
the trigger can fire when multiple events start at the same time (e.g., use
`queued` or `parallel` instead). Note that calendars are read once every 15
minutes. When testing, make sure you do not plan events less than 15 minutes
away from the current time, or your {% term trigger %} might not fire.

See [Automation Trigger Variables: Calendar](/docs/automation/templating/#calendar) 
for additional trigger data available for conditions or actions.

### Automation recipes

Below are a few example ways you can use Calendar triggers.

{% details "Example: Calendar Event Notification " %}

This example automation consists of:

- For the calendar entity `calendar.personal`.
- At the start of any calendar event.
- Send a notification with the title and start time of the event.
- Allowing multiple events starting at the same time.

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Calendar notification
    trigger:
      - platform: calendar
        event: start
        entity_id: calendar.personal
    action:
      - service: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          message: >-
            Event {{ trigger.calendar_event.summary }} @
            {{ trigger.calendar_event.start }}
```
{% endraw %}

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Example: Calendar Event Light Schedule " %}

This example consists of:

- For the calendar entity ` calendar.device_automation`.
- When event summary contains `Front Lights`.
- Turn on and off light named `light.front` when the event starts and ends.

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Front Light Schedule
    trigger:
      - platform: calendar
        event: start
        entity_id: calendar.device_automation
      - platform: calendar
        event: end
        entity_id: calendar.device_automation
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ 'Front Lights' in trigger.calendar_event.summary }}"
    action:
      - if:
          - "{{ trigger.event == 'start' }}"
        then:
          - service: light.turn_on
            entity_id: light.front
        else:
          - service: light.turn_off
            entity_id: light.front
```
{% endraw %}

{% enddetails %}

## Services

Some calendar {% term integrations %} allow Home Assistant to manage your calendars
directly using {% term services %}. The services provided by some calendar {% term entity %} are described below or you can read more about [Service Calls](/docs/scripts/service-calls/).

### Service `calendar.create_event`

Add a new calendar event. A calendar `target` is selected with a [Target Selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#target-selector) and the `data` payload supports the following fields:

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `summary` | no | Acts as the title of the event. | Bowling
| `description` | yes | The description of the event. | Birthday bowling
| `start_date_time` | yes | The date and time the event should start. | 2019-03-10 20:00:00
| `end_date_time` | yes | The date and time the event should end (exclusive). | 2019-03-10 23:00:00
| `start_date` | yes | The date the whole day event should start. | 2019-03-10
| `end_date` | yes | The date the whole day event should end (exclusive). | 2019-03-11
| `in` | yes | Days or weeks that you want to create the event in. | "days": 2
| `location` | yes | The location of the event. | Bowling center


<div class='note'>

You either use `start_date_time` and `end_date_time`, or `start_date` and `end_date`, or `in`.

</div>

This is a full example of a {% term service %} call in YAML:

```yaml
service: calendar.create_event
target:
  entity_id: calendar.device_automation_schedules
data:
  summary: "Example"
  start_date: "2022-10-01"
  end_date: "2022-10-02"
```

Home Assistant Calendars do not allow zero duration Calendar events. The following would create a one minute long event starting "now". This could be used to record an external event in a Calendar.

{% raw %}
```yaml
service: calendar.create_event
target:
  entity_id: calendar.device_automation_schedules
data:
  summary: "Example"
  start_date_time: "{{ now() }}"
  end_date_time: "{{ now() + timedelta(minutes=1) }}"
```
{% endraw %}


### Service `calendar.get_events`

This service populates [Response Data](/docs/scripts/service-calls#use-templates-to-handle-response-data)
with calendar events within a date range. It can return events from multiple calendars.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `start_date_time` | yes | Return active events after this time (exclusive). When not set, defaults to now. | 2019-03-10 20:00:00
| `end_date_time` | yes | Return active events before this time (exclusive). Cannot be used with `duration`. You must specify either `end_date_time` or `duration`.| 2019-03-10 23:00:00
| `duration` | yes | Return active events from `start_date_time` until the specified duration. Cannot be used with `end_date_time`. You must specify either `duration` or `end_date_time`. | `days: 2`

<div class='note'>

Use only one of `end_date_time` or `duration`.

</div>

```yaml
service: calendar.get_events
target:
  entity_id:
    - calendar.school
    - calendar.work
data:
  duration:
    hours: 24
response_variable: agenda
```

The response data contains a field for every calendar entity (e.g. `calendar.school` and `calendar.work` in this case).
Every calendar entity has a field `events` containing a list of events with these fields:

| Response data | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `summary` | The title of the event. | Bowling
| `description` | The description of the event. | Birthday bowling
| `start` | The date or date time the event starts. | 2019-03-10 20:00:00
| `end` | The date or date time the event ends (exclusive). | 2019-03-10 23:00:00
| `location` | The location of the event. | Bowling center

This example uses a template with response data in another service call:

{% raw %}
```yaml
service: notify.nina
data:
  title: Daily agenda for {{ now().date() }}
  message: >-
    Your school calendar for today:
    {% for event in agenda["calendar.school_calendar"]["events"] %}
    {{ event.start}}: {{ event.summary }}<br>
    {% endfor %}
    Your work calendar for today:
    {% for event in agenda["calendar.work_calendar"]["events"] %}
    {{ event.start}}: {{ event.summary }}<br>
    {% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}
