The `free_mobile` {% term integration %} uses the French mobile operator [Free Mobile](http://mobile.free.fr/) to send SMS to your own cell phone.

## Prerequisites

Before doing anything, you have to activate the SMS API option in your Free Mobile account (In "Gérer mon compte -> Mes Options"). Activating this option will automatically generate a token which is required in your configuration.

This API only sends classic SMS messages and only to the cell phone of the account owner. So you only have to provide a text message in your payload.

{% note %}
If you disable and re-enable the SMS API option, please be sure to update your token in your configuration.
{% endnote %}

## Configuration

To use this notification platform in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
