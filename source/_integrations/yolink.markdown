Integrates [YoLink](https://www.yosmart.com/) Devices into Home Assistant.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% details "Using custom application credentials" %}
Home Assistant will use account linking provided by Nabu Casa for authenticating with YoLink, this service is provided for free and does not require a Nabu Casa subscription. The steps below are thus not required.
If you want to use separate credentials, please contact <service@yosmart.com> to obtain a `client_id` and `client_secret`. Then you can add your credentials via application credentials. Settings > Devices & services > click the menu (three dots at the top right of the screen) and then **Application Credentials**. Enter your credentials in the pop-up window.
{% enddetails %}

## Community notes

1. This integration requires an MQTT connection to be established via port 8003. If you are using a firewall, please allow communication via port 8003 in the firewall settings.  
2. If you use a network proxy, such as a VPN, the integration may not be able to update the device status. Turn off the VPN.
3. Please do not use UAC as credentials for the Home Assistant YoLink integration.
