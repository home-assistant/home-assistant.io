The `yeelightsunflower` {% term integration %} allows you to control your Yeelight Sunflower light bulbs with Home Assistant.

<div class='note warning'>
The "Yeelight Sunflower" bulbs are not the same as the "Yeelight WiFi" bulbs.
</div>

To enable your lights, add the following lines to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: yeelightsunflower
    host: 192.168.1.59
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: IP address of your Yeelight Sunflower hub.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note'>
When the hub is loaded, your lights will appear as devices with their Zigbee IDs as part of the entity name.
</div>
