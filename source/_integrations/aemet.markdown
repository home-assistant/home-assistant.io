The AEMET weather platform uses [AEMET OpenData](https://opendata.aemet.es/) as a source for current meteorological data for your location. AEMET stands for "Agencia Estatal de Meteorología", which is the Spanish Meteorological Agency.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Sensor
- Weather

You need an API key, which is free but requires a [registration](https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/altaUsuario).
The AEMET OpenData service is completely free but is limited to the Spanish territory.

## Configuration

To add AEMET OpenData integration go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** and find the integration in the list.

Longitude:

{% endconfiguration_basic %}

The integration creates one weather entity per forecast mode and also sensors for all available conditions. There are two forecast modes, `daily` for daily forecast up to 6 days or `hourly` for an hourly forecast up to 3 days.

For each condition, the following sensors are created:
