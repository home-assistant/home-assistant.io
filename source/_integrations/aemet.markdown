The AEMET weather platform uses [AEMET OpenData](https://opendata.aemet.es/) as a source for current meteorological data for your location. AEMET stands for "Agencia Estatal de MeteorologÃ­a", which is the Spanish Meteorological Agency.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Sensor
- Weather

You need an API key, which is free but requires a [registration](https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/altaUsuario).
The AEMET OpenData service is completely free but is limited to the Spanish territory.

## Configuration

To add AEMET OpenData integration go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** and find the integration in the list.

Longitude:

{% endconfiguration_basic %}

The integration creates one weather entity per forecast mode and also sensors for all available conditions. There are two forecast modes, `daily` for daily forecast up to 6 days or `hourly` for an hourly forecast up to 3 days.

For each condition, the following sensors are created:
