The `coinbase` integration lets you access account balances and exchange rates from [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com).

You will need to obtain an API key from the API section in Coinbase's [User Settings](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) to use this integration. Your API key and secret should be of the form `organizations/XXXXX/apiKeys/XXXXX` and `-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n` respectively. When creating your API key, it is highly recommended to ensure that only the **View** box is ticked in the **API restrictions** section.

Number of decimal places for exchange rates:
  description: The number of decimals calculated in exchange rate sensors, a smaller number of decimal places may be returned when the upstream data from Coinbase lacks sufficient precision, this is usually the case when the exchange rate is much larger than the base currency and thus should have no significant effect on calculations.
