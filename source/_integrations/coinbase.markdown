The `coinbase` integration lets you access account balances and exchange rates from [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com).

You will need to obtain an API key from the API section in Coinbase's [User Settings](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) to use this integration. You need to select the account wallet or wallets (e.g. "BTC Wallet") that you wish to show in Home Assistant and give read access to `wallet:accounts` in order for the integration to access relevant data. It is worth noting that once you close the New API Key popup on Coinbase you will not be able to see the API Secret again.

Base currency for exchange rate sensors:

Number of decimal places for exchange rates:
  description: The number of decimals calculated in exchange rate sensors, a smaller number of decimal places may be returned when the upstream data from Coinbase lacks sufficient precision, this is usually the case when the exchange rate is much larger than the base currency and thus should have no significant effect on calculations.
