The `google_translate` text-to-speech platform uses the unofficial [Google Translate text-to-speech engine](https://translate.google.com/) to read a text with natural sounding voices. Contrary to what the name suggests, the integration only does text-to-speech and does not translate messages sent to it.

Check the [complete list of supported tld](https://www.google.com/supported_domains) for allowed TLD values. This is used to force the dialect used when multiple fall into the same 2-digit language code(i.e., _US, UK, AU_)

You can also use supported BCP 47 tags like the below or the 2-2 digit format for your supported dialect(`en-gb` or `en-us`). Below is a list of the currently implemented mappings:

| Dialect | Language | TLD    |
| ------- | -------- | ------ |
| en-us   | en       | com    |
| en-gb   | en       | co.uk  |
| en-uk   | en       | co.uk  |
| en-au   | en       | com.au |
| en-ca   | en       | ca     |
| en-in   | en       | co.in  |
| en-ie   | en       | ie     |
| en-za   | en       | co.za  |
| fr-ca   | fr       | ca     |
| fr-fr   | fr       | fr     |
| pt-br   | pt       | com.br |
| pt-pt   | pt       | pt     |
| es-es   | es       | es     |
| es-us   | es       | com    |


## Service speak

The `tts.speak` service is the modern way to use Google translate TTS action. Add the `speak` action, select the entity for your Google translate TTS (it's named for the language you created it with), select the media player entity or group to send the TTS audio to, and enter the message to speak.

For more options about `speak`, see the Speak section on the main [TTS](/integrations/tts/#service-speak) building block page.

In YAML, your action will look like this:
```yaml
service: tts.speak
target:
  entity_id: tts.google_en_com
data:
  media_player_entity_id: media_player.giant_tv
  message: Hello, can you hear me now?
```

## Service say (legacy)

{% tip %}
The `google_translate_say` service can be used when configuring the legacy `google_translate` text-to-speech platform in `configuration.yaml`. We recommend new users to instead set up the integration in the UI and use the `tts.speak` service with the corresponding Google Translate text-to-speech entity as target.
{% endtip %}

The `google_translate_say` service supports `language` and also `options` for setting `tld`. The text for speech is set with `message`. Since release 0.92, the service name can be defined in the configuration `service_name` option.

Say to all `media_player` device entities:

```yaml
# Replace google_translate_say with <platform>_say when you use a different platform.
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: all
  message: "May the force be with you."
```

Say to the `media_player.floor` device entity:

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.floor
  message: "May the force be with you."
```

Say to the `media_player.floor` device entity in French:

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.floor
  message: "Que la force soit avec toi."
  language: "fr"
```

Say to the `media_player.floor` device entity in UK English:

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.floor
  message: "May the force be with you."
  language: "en-uk"
```

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  entity_id: media_player.floor
  message: "May the force be with you."
  language: "en"
  options:
    tld: co.uk
```

With a template:

{% raw %}

```yaml
service: tts.google_translate_say
data:
  message: "Temperature is {{states('sensor.temperature')}}."
  cache: false
```

{% endraw %}
