This `plant` {% term integration %} lets you merge moisture, conductivity, light intensity, temperature and battery level for a plant into a single UI element. It also supports setting minimum and maximum values for each measurement and will change its state to "problem" if it is not within those limits.

## Configuration

To use your `plant` sensor in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
plant:
  name_of_your_plant:
    sensors:
      moisture: sensor.my_sensor_moisture
      battery: sensor.my_sensor_battery
      temperature: sensor.my_sensor_temperature
      conductivity: sensor.my_sensor_conductivity
      brightness: sensor.my_sensor_brightness
    min_moisture: 20
```

## Examples
### Using plain MQTT sensor to get the data
This is a practical example that uses a multiple of `MQTT sensors` to supply the readings used by the `plant` sensor.
Another good source of this data would be the [Mi Flora](/integrations/miflora) integration.

If the sensor data is within the min/max values the status will be `ok`, if not the status will be `problem`. You can use this to trigger a notification, if there is a problem with your plant. Of course you can only monitor attributes of your plant, where the sensor is configured and is providing the data.

## Data source

The main sources of the data will usually be a [MiFlora sensor](/integrations/miflora) or a [MQTT sensor](/integrations/sensor.mqtt/) receiving the data from a [PlantGateway](https://github.com/ChristianKuehnel/plantgateway).

If you want to get the date via a PlantGateway, this is a typical configuration for the MQTT sensors:

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
plant:
  simulated_plant:
    sensors:
      moisture: sensor.mqtt_plant_moisture
      battery: sensor.mqtt_plant_battery
      temperature: sensor.mqtt_plant_temperature
      conductivity: sensor.mqtt_plant_conductivity
      brightness: sensor.mqtt_plant_brightness
    min_moisture: 20
    max_moisture: 60
    min_battery: 17
    min_conductivity: 500
    min_temperature: 15

sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: my_plant_moisture
    state_topic: my_plant_topic
    value_template: "{{ value_json.moisture | int }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: my_plant_battery
    state_topic: my_plant_topic
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery | int }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: my_plant_temperature
    state_topic: my_plant_topic
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature | float }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: my_plant_conductivity
    state_topic: my_plant_topic
    value_template: "{{ value_json.conductivity | int }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "µS/cm"
  - platform: mqtt
    name: my_plant_brightness
    state_topic: my_plant_topic
    value_template: "{{ value_json.brightness | int }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "Lux"
```

{% endraw %}

You have to replace the `state_topic` with the value that you configured in the PlantGateway. It also depends on the global configuration of your MQTT server.
