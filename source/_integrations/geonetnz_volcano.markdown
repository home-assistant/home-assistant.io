The `geonetnz_volcano` integration lets you use a GeoJSON feed provided by 
New Zealand's [GeoNet](https://www.geonet.org.nz/) with information 
about volcanoes in the New Zealand region. 
It shows information of those volcanoes filtered by distance to Home Assistant's 
location.

Entities are generated and updated automatically with each update 
from the feed. Each entity defines the [volcanic alert level](https://www.geonet.org.nz/about/volcano/val) 
as its state.  Latitude and longitude of the volcano are included as attributes 
to show on the default map automatically.

The data is updated every 5 minutes.
