The Google Sheets integration allows you to connect your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) to Home Assistant. The integration adds an actiion to allow you to append rows to a Sheets document. The idea is that you can store data on there for further processing. When you set up a config entry, your drive will have a new sheet called Home Assistant. You can then rename this to whatever you like.

**Note**:
The integration currently only has access to that one document that is created during setup.

## Prerequisites

You need to configure developer credentials to allow Home Assistant to access your Google Account.
These credentials are the same as the ones for [Nest](/integrations/nest), [YouTube](/integrations/youtube), and [Google Mail](/integrations/google_mail).
These are not the same as *Device Auth* credentials previously recommended for [Google Calendar](/integrations/google).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

{% include integrations/google_oauth.md %}

## Troubleshooting

If you have an error with your credentials you can delete them in the [Application Credentials](/integrations/application_credentials/) user interface.

### Video tutorial

This video tutorial explains how to set up the Google Sheets integration and how you can add data from Home Assistant to a Google Sheet.

### Action `google_sheets.append_sheet`

You can use the `google_sheets.append_sheet` action to add rows of data to the Sheets document created at setup.

{% details "Create event action details" %}

| Data attribute | Optional | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------|
| `config_entry` | no | Config entry to use. |
| `worksheet` | yes | Name of the worksheet. Defaults to the first one in the document. | Sheet1 |
| `data` | no | Data to be appended to the worksheet. This puts the data on new rows, one value per column. | {"hello": world, "cool": True, "count": 5} |

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example action
action: google_sheets.append_sheet
data:
  config_entry: 1b4a46c6cba0677bbfb5a8c53e8618b0
  worksheet: "Car Charging"
  data:
    Date: "{{ now().strftime('%-d-%b-%y') }}"
    KWh: "{{ states('input_number.car_charging_kwh')|float(0) }}"
    Cost: "{{ states('input_number.car_charging_cost')|float(0) }}"

# Example action with multiple rows
action: google_sheets.append_sheet
data:
  config_entry: 1b4a46c6cba0677bbfb5a8c53e8618b0
  worksheet: "Car Charging"
  data:
    - Item: "Car 1 cost"
      Cost: "{{ states('input_number.car_1_charging_cost')|float(0) }}"
    - Item: "Car 2 cost"
      Cost: "{{ states('input_number.car_2_charging_cost')|float(0) }}"
```

{% endraw %}

{% enddetails %}
