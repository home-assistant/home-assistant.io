The `concord232` platform provides integration with GE, Interlogix (and other brands) alarm panels that support the RS-232 Automation Control Panel interface module (or have it built in). Supported panels include Concord 4.

To use this platform, you will need to have the external concord232 client and server installed. The server must be running on the device which is connected to the automation module's serial port. The client must be installed on the machine running Home Assistant. These may often be the same machine, but do not have to be. For additional details in setting up and testing the client and server, see <https://github.com/JasonCarter80/concord232>.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Alarm](#alarm-control-panel)
- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)

## Alarm Control Panel

To enable the alarm control panel platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: concord232
```

{% configuration %}
host:

  required: false
  type: string
  default: localhost

  required: false
  type: string
  default: audible
{% endconfiguration %}

## Binary Sensor

To enable the binary sensor platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: concord232
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The host where the concord232 server process is running.
  required: false
  type: string
