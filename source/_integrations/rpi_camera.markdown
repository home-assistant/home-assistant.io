The `rpi_camera` integration allows you to integrate the Raspberry Pi camera into Home Assistant. This integration uses the application [`raspistill`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md) to store the image from camera.

<div class='note'>
This integration is only available on Home Assistant Core installation types. Unfortunately, it cannot be used with Home Assistant OS, Supervised or Container.

## Configuration

To enable this camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
rpi_camera:
```

The whole set of configuration variables is documented here [`Raspberry Pi Camera Module - Raspberry Pi Documentation`](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md).
They are not all wrapped by this `rpi_camera` platform.
