The **Devialet** integration lets you control your [Devialet](https://www.devialet.com) wireless speakers from Home Assistant.

<div class='note'>

- For a stereo setup, only one of the speakers need to be configured.
- Make sure your Devialet firmware version is 2.16.1 or later. Otherwise, expect functions not to work.
- Assigning a fixed IP address to your speakers is highly recommended.
