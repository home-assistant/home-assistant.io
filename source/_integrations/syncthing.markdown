[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers 
in real-time, safely protected from prying eyes.

The Syncthing integration allows you to monitor states of your synced folders from within Home Assistant and set up automations based on the information.

## Prerequisites

To set up the monitoring you need to get an **API key**. Open the Syncthing web 
interface (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8384`) in the browser and go to **Actions** > **Settings**. You will find
the key on the right of the settings dialog.
