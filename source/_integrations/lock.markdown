Keeps track which locks are in your environment, their state and allows you to control them.

- Maintains a state per lock and a combined state `all_locks`.
- Registers actions `lock.lock`, `lock.unlock`, and `lock.open` (unlatch) to control locks.

## The state of a lock entity

A lock entity can have the following states:

- **Jammed**: The lock is currently jammed.
- **Open**: Indication of whether the lock is currently open.
- **Opening**: Indication of whether the lock is currently opening.
- **Locked**: The lock is currently locked.
- **Locking**: The lock is in the process of being locked.
- **Unlocking**: The lock is in the process of being unlocked.
- **Unavailable**: The entity is currently unavailable.
- **Unknown**: The state is not yet known.

## Actions

A lock integration provides the following actions:

### Action `lock.lock` 

Lock your door, the attribute should appear under a 'data' attribute for the action.

| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `entity_id`    | no       | Entity of the relevant lock. |

  action: lock.lock
  target:
    entity_id: lock.my_place
```

### Action `lock.unlock` 

Unlock your door, the attribute should appear under a 'data' attribute for the action.
