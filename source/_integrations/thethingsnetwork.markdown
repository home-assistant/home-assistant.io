<div class='note warning'>
  This integration only supports TTNv2 that has been definitively switched off in 2022 (deprecated).
  For TTNv3, use the [MQTT integration](/integrations/mqtt).
</div>

The `thethingsnetwork` integration allows one to interact with the [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org). This community-driven and open network supports [LoRaWAN](https://www.lora-alliance.org/) for long range (~5 to 15 km) communication with a low bandwidth (51 bytes/message). [Gateways](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/) transfers the received data from the sensors to the The Things Network.

The Things network support various integrations to make the data available:

| The Things Network Integration | Home Assistant platform |
|---|---|
| [MQTT](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/mqtt/) | |
| [Storage](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/storage/) | [`thethingsnetwork`](#sensor) |
| [HTTP](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/http/) | |

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Sensor](#sensor)

## Setup

Visit the [The Things Network Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) website, log in with your The Things Network credentials, choose your application from **Applications**.

The **Application ID** is used to identify the scope of your data.

</p>

You need an access key to be able to read the data from your application.

Access keys
</p>

## Configuration

To enable this integration, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
thethingsnetwork:
  app_id: sensor-123
  access_key: ttn-account-v2.xxxxxxxxxxx_yyyyyyyyyyy
```

{% configuration %}
app_id:
  description: The Application ID.
  required: true
  type: string
access_key:
  description: The access key.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Sensor

The `thethingsnetwork` sensor platform allows you to get data from a [The Things Network Storage Integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/storage/).

This platform requires that the [The Things Network integration](#configuration) is set up and the [The Things Network Storage Integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/storage/) as well.

### Prerequisites

Visit the [The Things Network Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) website, log in with your The Things Network credentials, choose your application from **Applications** and go to **Integrations**.

Add a new integration.

### Configuration

To enable this platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: thethingsnetwork
    device_id: ha-demo
    values:
      current: ampere
      voltage: V
```

{% configuration %}
  device_id:
    description: The ID of the device.
    required: true
    type: string
  values:
    description: The sensor values with their unit of measurement
    required: true
    type: list
{% endconfiguration %}
