The System monitor integration allows you to monitor disk usage,
memory usage, CPU usage, and running processes. 

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Sensors

**All entities are disabled by default, you need to enable the entities that you wish to use.**

### Disks

- Disk free - (One per disk/mount point)
- Disk use - (One per disk/mount point)
- Disk usage (percent) - (One per disk/mount point)

### Network

- IPv4 address - (One per network interface)
- IPv6 address - (One per network interface)
- Network in - (One per network interface)
- Network out - (One per network interface)
- Packets in - (One per network interface)
- Packets out - (One per network interface)
- Network throughput in - (One per network interface)
- Network throughput out - (One per network interface)

### Other

- Last boot
- Load (15m)
- Load (5m)
- Load (1m)
- Memory free
- Memory use
- Memory usage (percent)
- Processor use
- Processor temperature
- Swap free
- Swap use
- Swap usage (percent)

## Add `process` binary sensor

The `process` binary sensor needs to be configured by the config entry options. Go to **{% my integrations title="Settings > Devices & Services" %}**, select the **System Monitor** integration and click **Configure** to select which `process` binary sensors should be created.

## Disk usage

**Note:** The disk usage sensors do not support monitoring folder/directory sizes. Instead, it is only concerned with "disks" (more specifically mount points on Linux).

```bash
$ df -H
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root        29G   12G   16G  42% /
devtmpfs        805M     0  805M   0% /dev
tmpfs           934M     0  934M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/mmcblk0p1  253M   54M  199M  22% /boot
```

## Processor temperature

- If no hardware sensor data is available (e.g., because the integration runs in a virtualized environment), the sensor entity will not be created.
- The unit of measurement (Celsius vs. Fahrenheit) will be chosen based on the system configuration.
- Only the very first processor related hardware sensor is read, i.e. no individual core temperatures are available (even if the hardware sensor provides that level of detail).
