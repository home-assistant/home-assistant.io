The Honeywell integration integrates Home Assistant with _US-based_ [Honeywell Total Connect Comfort (TCC)](https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/) climate systems.

If your system is compatible with this integration, then you will be able access it via [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/](https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/) (note the `/portal/`).

## Supported hardware

Home Assistant is integrated with the following devices through [https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/](https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/):

- Thermostats
  - Every thermostat is exposed as a climate entity
  - Known working devices: [TH6320R1004](https://customer.resideo.com/en-US/Pages/Product.aspx?cat=HonECC%2520Catalog&pid=TH6320R1004/U), [RTH9585WF1004](https://www.honeywellhome.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/wifi-thermostats/wifi-color-touchscreen-thermostat-rth9585wf1004-u/), [RTH6580WF](https://www.honeywellhome.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/wifi-thermostats/wifi-7-day-programmable-thermostat-rth6580wf1001-u1/)
- Sensors
  - A Temperature sensor entity
  - A Humidity sensor entity
  - Known working devices: [C7089R1013](https://customer.resideo.com/en-US/Pages/Product.aspx?cat=HonECC%20Catalog&pid=C7089R1013/U), [RTH6580WF](https://www.honeywellhome.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/wifi-thermostats/wifi-7-day-programmable-thermostat-rth6580wf1001-u1/)

Other devices like Security systems are not currently supported by this integration.

## Climate

The climate platform integrates Honeywell US-based thermostats into Home Assistant, allowing control of the thermostat through the user interface. The current inside temperature, operating mode, and fan state are also displayed on the thermostat card.

All [climate actions](/integrations/climate) are supported except set_swing_mode.

Due to the instability of the Honeywell total connect system, actions within automations should repeat until success similar to the following example:

```yaml
alias: "No one home"
description: "Everyone has left home"
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: zone.home
    for:
      minutes: 10
    below: 1
action:
  - repeat:
      sequence:
        - action: climate.set_temperature
          target:
            entity_id: climate.stat
          data:
            temperature: 64
        - delay:
            minutes: 1
      until:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: climate.stat
          attribute: temperature
          state: 64
```

## Sensor

The sensor platform integrates inside and outside temperature and humidity into Home Assistant as sensors for each device. Not every supported thermostat will support all sensors.

This integration will add Home Assistant sensors for the following:
|Sensor|Value|
--- | ---
|Outdoor temperature | Average temperature of all Honeywell Wireless Outdoor Sensors|
|Outdoor humidity | Average humidity of all Honeywell Wireless Outdoor Sensors|
|Indoor temperature | Current temperature as measured at the specific thermostat|
|Indoor humidity | Current humidity as measured at the specific thermostat|

## Switch

The switch entity integrates the emergency heat option for each device.  If the thermostat supports emergency heat, the switch entity will be created.

This integration will add a switch for the following:
|Switch|Value|
--- | ---
|Emergency Heat | Activates second stage heat source as primary heat|
