The `dlib_face_detect` image processing {% term integration %} allows you to use the [Dlib](http://www.dlib.net/) through Home Assistant. This platform enables face detection from cameras, and can fire events with attributes.

This can be used to trigger an automation rule. Further info is on the [integration](/integrations/image_processing/) page.

{% note %}
This integration is only available on Home Assistant Core installation types. Unfortunately, it cannot be used with Home Assistant OS, Supervised or Container.
