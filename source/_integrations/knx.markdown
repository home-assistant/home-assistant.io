The [KNX](https://www.knx.org) integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect to KNX/IP devices.

The integration requires a local KNX/IP interface or router. Through this, it will establish a connection between Home Assistant and your KNX bus.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Button](#button)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Cover](#cover)
- [Date](#date)
- [Fan](#fan)
- [Light](#light)
- [Notify](#notify)
- [Number](#number)
- [Scene](#scene)
- [Select](#select)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Switch](#switch)
- [Text](#text)
- [Time](#time)
- [Weather](#weather)

## Free KNX online training

As a Home Assistant KNX user, you can start a FREE KNX online training and get a discounted ETS Home license on the [KNX website](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/for-your-home/home-assistant/).

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Basic configuration

In order to make use of the various platforms that KNX offers you will need to add the relevant configuration sections to your setup. This could either all be in the Home Assistant main {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file, or in a separate YAML file that you include in the main file or even be split into multiple dedicated files. See [Splitting up the configuration](/docs/configuration/splitting_configuration/).
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
knx:
  # configure platforms directly in configuration.yaml
  binary_sensor:
    - name: "My first binary sensor"
      state_address: "1/2/3"
    # etc...
  # or outsource platform configuration to separate files
  sensor: !include knx_sensor.yaml
```

Please see the dedicated platform sections below about how to configure them correctly.

### Group addresses

Group addresses are configured as strings or integers in the format "1/2/3" for 3-level GA-structure, "1/2" for 2-level GA-structure or "1" for free GA-structure.

The HA KNX integration uses configured `state_address` or `*_state_address` to update the state of a function. These addresses are read by GroupValueRead requests on startup and when there was no incoming telegram for one hour (default `sync_state`).

It is possible to configure passive/listening group addresses for all functions of every KNX platform (except `expose` and `notify`). This allows having multiple group addresses to update the state of its function (e.g., the brightness of a light). When group addresses are configured as a list of strings, the first item is the active sending or state-reading address and the rest is registered as passive addresses. This schema behaves like in ETS configuration where the first is the "sending" address and others are just for updating the group object.

If your KNX device provides active state group objects it is advised to use `*_state_address` instead of passive addresses as it reduces configuration complexity and avoids wrong states (e.g., when channels are logically locked).

```yaml
knx:
  switch:
    - name: "Switch without passive addresses"
      address: "1/1/1" # this is the address that will be sent to
      state_address: "8/8/8"  # this is the address GroupValueRead requests are sent to
    - name: "Switch with passive addresses"
      address: 
        - "1/1/1" # this is the address that will be sent to
        - "1/1/2" # this and following are passive addresses
        - "1/1/3"
      state_address: 
        - "8/8/8" # this is the address GroupValueRead requests are sent to
        - "8/8/2" # this and following are passive addresses
        - "8/8/3"
```

## Connection

Connection parameters are set up when adding the integration and can be changed from the `Integrations` panel.

Use `route back` if your tunneling server is located on a different network.

### KNX Secure

The KNX integration supports IP Secure and Data Secure .

You can configure the IP Secure credentials either manually or by providing a `.knxkeys` file, which you can obtain by exporting the keyring in ETS as seen in the screenshot below.
Data Secure credentials are always sourced from a `.knxkeys` file. You can import or update the Keyring file from the integrations settings.

For Data Secure, please make sure that all secured group addresses you want to use in Home Assistant are assigned to a tunnel of your interface or a dummy device in ETS and all participating devices are updated accordingly.

![Export Keyring in ETS5](/images/integrations/knx/export_keyring_ets.png)

If you decide to configure IP Secure manually you will need the user ID, the user password and the device authentication password.

The user id 0 is reserved and the user id 1 is used for management tasks, thus you will need to specify a user id that is 2 or higher according to the tunneling channel you would like to use.

The following screenshot will show how you can get the device authentication password in ETS.

![Obtain device authentication password in ETS](/images/integrations/knx/device_authentication_password.png)

The user password can be obtained almost the same way as seen in the below screenshot.

![Obtain the user password in ETS](/images/integrations/knx/user_password.png)

## Triggers

The KNX integration provides its own trigger platform which can be used in automations.

### Telegram trigger

The `knx.telegram` trigger can be used to trigger automations on incoming or outgoing KNX telegrams.

<div class='note'>

This trigger is also provided as a device trigger by the `KNX Interface` device. It supports setting the options in the automation builder UI, but doesn't support setting a specific <abbr title="data point type">DPT</abbr> (`type`) to decode the payload as it always relies on project data.

</div>

{% configuration %}
destination:
  description: A group address or a list of group addresses the trigger should listen on. If not set, or an empty list, the trigger will listen on all group addresses.
  type: [string, list]
  required: false

#### Examples

Example automation configuration

```yaml
- alias: Single group address trigger
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - platform: knx.telegram
    destination: 1/2/3
    group_value_read: false
    outgoing: false
  condition: []
  action: []
  mode: single
```

Example trigger data

```yaml
variables:
  trigger:
    id: "0"
    idx: "0"
    alias: null
    destination: 1/2/3
    destination_name: Light office brightness
    direction: Incoming
    dpt_main: 5
    dpt_sub: 1
    dpt_name: percent
    payload:
      - 255
    source: 1.0.51
    source_name: Dimming actuator 1
    telegramtype: GroupValueWrite
    timestamp: "2024-01-09T10:38:28.447487+01:00"
    unit: "%"
    value: 100
context: null
```

## Events

<div class='note'>

For automation triggers, it is recommended to use the [knx.telegram](#telegram-trigger) trigger instead of `knx_event`.

</div>

```yaml
knx:
  event:
    - address:
        - "0/1/*"
    - address:
        - "1/2/*"
        - "1/3/2-4"
      type: "2byte_unsigned"
    - address:
        - "3/4/5"
      type: "2byte_float"
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: Defines a list of patterns for matching KNX group addresses. Telegrams with destination addresses matching one of the patterns are sent to the Home Assistant event bus as `knx_event`.
  required: true
  type: [list, string]
type:
  description: Telegram payloads in `knx_event` events will be decoded using the configured type (DPT) for the addresses in the same block. The decoded value will be written to the event data `value` key. If not configured the `value` key will be `None` - the `data` key will still hold the raw payload (use this for DPT 1, 2, 3). All sensor types are valid types - see [KNX Sensor](#sensor) (e.g., "2byte_float" or "1byte_signed").
  type: [string, integer]
  required: false
{% endconfiguration %}

Every telegram that matches an address pattern with its destination field will be announced on the event bus as a `knx_event` event containing data attributes

- `data` contains the raw payload data (e.g., 1 or "[12, 55]").
- `destination` the KNX group address the telegram is sent to as string (e.g., "1/2/3").
- `direction` the direction of the telegram as string ("Incoming" / "Outgoing").
- `source` the KNX individual address of the sender as string (e.g., "1.2.3").
- `telegramtype` the APCI service of the telegram. "GroupValueWrite", "GroupValueRead" or "GroupValueResponse" generate a knx_event.
- `value` contains the decoded payload value if `type` is configured for the address. Will be `None` for "GroupValueRead" telegrams.

## Services

In order to directly interact with the KNX bus, you can use the following services:

### Send

```txt
Domain: knx
Service: send
Service Data: {"address": "1/0/15", "payload": 0, "type": "temperature"}
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: KNX group address.
  type: string
payload:
  description: Payload to send to the bus. When `type` is not set, raw bytes are sent. Integers are then treated as DPT 1/2/3 payloads. For DPTs > 6 bits send a list. Each value represents 1 octet (0-255). Pad with 0 to DPT byte length.
  type: [integer, list]
type:
  description: If set, the payload will not be sent as raw bytes, but encoded as given DPT. KNX sensor types are valid values - see table in [KNX Sensor](#sensor).
  type: [string, integer, float]
response:
  description: If set to `true`, the telegram will be sent as a `GroupValueResponse` instead of a `GroupValueWrite`.
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

### Read

You can use the `homeassistant.update_entity` service call to issue GroupValueRead requests for all `*state_address` of an entity.
To manually send GroupValueRead requests, use the `knx.read` service. The response can be used in automations by the `knx.telegram` trigger and it will be processed in KNX entities.

```txt
Domain: knx
Service: read
Service Data: {"address": "1/0/15"}
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: Group address(es) to send read request to. Lists will read multiple group addresses.
  type: [string, list]
{% endconfiguration %}

```yaml
# Example automation to update a cover position after 10 seconds of movement initiation
automation:
  - trigger:
      - platform: knx.telegram
        # Cover move trigger
        destination: "0/4/20"
    action:
      - delay: 0:0:10
      - service: knx.read
        data:
          # Cover position address
          address: "0/4/21"

  - trigger:
      - platform: homeassistant
        event: start
    action:
      # Register the group address to trigger a knx_event
      - service: knx.event_register
        data:
          # Cover move trigger
          address: "0/4/20"
```

### Register event

The `knx.event_register` service can be used to register (or unregister) group addresses to fire `knx_event` Events. Events for group addresses configured in the `event` key in `configuration.yaml` cannot be unregistered. See [knx_event](#events)

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: Group address that shall be added or removed.
  required: true
  type: [string, list]
remove:
  description: If `True` the group address will be removed.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
type:
  description: If set, the payload will be decoded as given DPT in the event data `value` key. KNX sensor types are valid values [KNX Sensor](#sensor) (e.g., "2byte_float" or "1byte_signed").
  type: [string, integer]
  required: false
{% endconfiguration %}

### Register exposure

The `knx.exposure_register` service can be used to register (or unregister) exposures to the KNX bus. Exposures defined in `configuration.yaml` can not be unregistered. Per address only one exposure can be registered. See [expose](#exposing-entity-states-entity-attributes-or-time-to-knx-bus)

{% configuration %}
remove:
  description: In addition to the configuration variables of [expose](#exposing-entity-states-entity-attributes-or-time-to-knx-bus) `remove` set to `True` can be used to remove exposures. Only `address` is required for removal.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

## Exposing entity states, entity attributes or time to KNX bus

KNX integration is able to expose entity states or attributes to KNX bus. The integration will broadcast any change of the exposed value to the KNX bus and answer read requests to the specified group address.
It is also possible to expose the current time and date. These are sent to the bus every hour.

<div class='note'>

Expose is only triggered on state changes. If you need periodical telegrams, use an automation with the `knx.send` service to send the value to the bus.

</div>

## Binary sensor

The KNX binary sensor platform allows you to monitor [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) binary sensors.

Binary sensors are read-only. To write to the KNX bus configure an exposure [KNX Integration Expose](/integrations/knx/#exposing-entity-states-entity-attributes-or-time-to-knx-bus).

```yaml
knx:
  binary_sensor:
    - name: "Sensor 1"

```

{% configuration %}
state_address:
  description: KNX group address of the binary sensor. *DPT 1*
  required: true
  type: [string, list]
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string

    - `true` equivalent to "expire 60" (default)

    - `false` no GroupValueRead telegrams will be sent to the bus

    - `every <minutes>` to update it regularly every \<minutes\>

    - `expire <minutes>` to read the state from the KNX bus when no telegram was received for \<minutes\>

context_timeout:
  description: The time in seconds between multiple identical telegram payloads would count towards the internal counter that is used for automations. Ex. You have automations in place that trigger your lights on button press and another set of lights if you click that button twice. This setting defines the time that a second button press would count toward, so if you set this 3.0 you can take up to 3 seconds in order to trigger the second button press. If set `ignore_internal_state` will be set to `true` internally. Maximum value is 10.0.
  required: false
  type: float

entity_category:
  description: The [category](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity#generic-properties) of the entity.
  required: false
  type: string

{% endconfiguration %}

### Support for automations

You can use a built in event in order to trigger an automation (e.g. to switch on a light when a switch was pressed).

Let's pretend you have a binary sensor with the name `Livingroom.Switch` and you want to switch one light on when the button was pressed once and two other lights when the button was pressed twice. `context_timeout` has to be configured in order for this to work.

```yaml
# Example automation.yaml entry
automation:
  - trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.livingroom_switch
      attribute: counter
      above: 0
      below: 2
    condition: 
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.cover_abstell
        state: "on"
    action:
      - entity_id: light.hue_color_lamp_1
        service: light.turn_on
  - trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.livingroom_switch
      attribute: counter
      above: 1
      below: 3
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.cover_abstell
        state: "on"
    action:
      - entity_id: light.hue_bloom_1
        service: homeassistant.turn_on
      - entity_id: light.hue_bloom_2
        service: homeassistant.turn_on
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string
counter:
  description: Set to 2 if you only want the action to be executed if the button was pressed twice. Set to 3 for three times button pressed.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 1
hook:
  description: Indicates if the automation should be executed on what state of the binary sensor. Values are "on" or "off".
  required: false
  type: string
  default: "on"
action:
  description: Specify a list of actions analog to the [automation rules](/docs/automation/action/).
  required: false

## Button

The KNX button platform allows to send concurrent predefined values via the frontend or a platform service. When a user presses the button, the assigned generic raw payload is sent to the KNX bus.

<div class='note'>

Telegrams received on the KNX bus for the group address of a button are not reflected in a new button state. Use the `knx.telegram` trigger if you want to automate on a specific payload received on a group address.

</div>

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  button:
    - name: "DPT 1 - True button"
      address: "0/0/1"
    - name: "100% button"
      address: "0/0/2"
      payload: 0xFF
      payload_length: 1
    - name: "Temperature button"
      address: "0/0/3"
      value: 21.5
      type: temperature
```

<div class='note'>

When `type` is used `value` is required, `payload` is invalid.
When `payload_length` is used `value` is invalid.

## Climate

The KNX climate platform is used as an interface to KNX thermostats and room controllers.

To use your KNX thermostats in your installation, add the following lines to your top level [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx) configuration key in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: "Kitchen"
      temperature_address: "5/1/1"
      setpoint_shift_address: "5/1/2"
      setpoint_shift_state_address: "5/1/3"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/4"
      operation_mode_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/6"
```

Alternatively, if your device has dedicated binary group addresses for frost/night/comfort mode:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: "Kitchen"
      temperature_address: "5/1/1"
      setpoint_shift_address: "5/1/2"
      setpoint_shift_state_address: "5/1/3"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/4"
      operation_mode_frost_protection_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_night_address: "5/1/6"
      operation_mode_comfort_address: "5/1/7"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/8"
```

If your device doesn't support setpoint_shift calculations (i.e., if you don't provide a `setpoint_shift_address` value) please set the `min_temp` and `max_temp`
attributes of the climate device to avoid issues with exceeding valid temperature values in the frontend. Please do also make sure to add the `target_temperature_address` to the configuration in this case.:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: "Kitchen"
      temperature_address: "5/1/2"
      target_temperature_address: "5/1/4"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/1"
      operation_mode_frost_protection_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_night_address: "5/1/6"
      operation_mode_comfort_address: "5/1/7"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/8"
      operation_mode_standby_address: "5/1/9"
      min_temp: 7.0
      max_temp: 32.0
```

`setpoint_shift_mode` allows the two following DPTs to be used:

- DPT6010 (for 1 byte signed integer with scale factor)
- DPT9002 (for 2 byte float)

Example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  climate:
    - name: "Kitchen"
      temperature_address: "5/1/1"
      setpoint_shift_address: "5/1/2"
      setpoint_shift_state_address: "5/1/3"
      setpoint_shift_mode: "DPT9002"
      target_temperature_state_address: "5/1/4"
      operation_mode_address: "5/1/5"
      operation_mode_state_address: "5/1/6"
```

`operation_mode_frost_protection_address` / `operation_mode_night_address` / `operation_mode_comfort_address` / `operation_mode_standby_address` are not necessary if `operation_mode_address` is specified.
If the actor doesn't support explicit state group objects the `*_state_address` can be configured with the same group address as the writeable `*_address`. The read flag for the `*_state_address` group object has to be set in ETS to support initial reading e.g., when starting Home Assistant.

The following values are valid for the `heat_cool_address` and the `heat_cool_state_address`:

- `0` (cooling)
- `1` (heating)

The following values are valid for the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `hvac_mode` attribute. Supported values for your KNX thermostats can be specified via `controller_modes` configuration variable:

- `Off` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_OFF` within Home Assistant)
- `Auto` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_AUTO` within Home Assistant)
- `Heat` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_HEAT` within Home Assistant)
- `Cool` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_COOL` within Home Assistant)
- `Fan only` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_FAN_ONLY` within Home Assistant)
- `Dry` (maps internally to `HVAC_MODE_DRY` within Home Assistant)

The following presets are valid for the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `preset_mode` attribute. Supported values for your KNX thermostats can be specified via `operation_modes` configuration variable:

- `Auto` (maps to `none` of the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `preset_mode` attribute)
- `Comfort` (maps to `comfort` of the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `preset_mode` attribute)
- `Standby` (maps to `away` of the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `preset_mode` attribute)
- `Night` (maps to `sleep` of the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `preset_mode` attribute)
- `Frost Protection` (maps to `eco` of the Home Assistant [Climate](/integrations/climate/) `preset_mode` attribute)

## Cover

The KNX cover platform is used as an interface to KNX covers.

<div class='note'>

Unlike most KNX devices, Home Assistant defines 0% as closed and 100% as fully open in regards to covers. The corresponding value inversion is done internally by the KNX integration.

Home Assistant will, by default, `close` a cover by moving it in the `DOWN` direction in the KNX nomenclature, and `open` a cover by moving it in the `UP` direction.

</div>

To use your KNX covers in your installation, add the following lines to your top level [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx) configuration key in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  cover:
    - name: "Kitchen shutter"

## Fan

The KNX fan integration is used to control KNX fans. Following control types are supported:

- Percentage controlled: Fans that set the percentage directly from 0-100%.
- Step controlled: Fans which have a fixed amount of steps to set. The integration will convert percentage to step automatically. The `max_step` attribute is set to the number of steps of the fan, not counting the `off`-step. Example: A fan supports the steps 0 to 3. To use this fan the `max_step` attribute has to be set to `3`. The integration will convert the percentage `66 %` to the step `2` when sending data to KNX.

To use your KNX fan in your installation, add the following lines to your top level [KNX Integration](/integrations/knx) configuration key in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  fan:

Many KNX devices can change their state internally without a message to the switch address on the KNX bus, e.g., if you configure a scene or a timer on a channel. The optional `state_address` can be used to inform Home Assistant about these state changes. If a KNX message is seen on the bus addressed to the given `state_address` (in most cases from the light actuator), it will overwrite the state of the object.

For switching/light actuators that are only controlled by a single group address and don't have dedicated state group objects you can set `state_address` to the same value as `address`.

*Note on tunable white:* Home Assistant uses Mireds as the unit for color temperature, whereas KNX typically uses Kelvin. The Kelvin/Mireds relationship is reciprocal, not linear, therefore the color temperature pickers (sliders) in Home Assistant may not align with ones of KNX visualizations. This is the expected behavior.

## Notify

The KNX notify platform allows you to send notifications to [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) devices as DPT16 strings.

```yaml
knx:
  notify:
    - name: "Alarm"
      address: "5/1/10"
```

{% configuration %}
address:
  description: KNX group address the notification will be sent to. *DPT 16*
  required: true
  type: [string, list]
name:
  description: A name for this device used within Home Assistant.

### Example service call

```yaml
service: notify.send_message
data:
  message: "Hello from HA!"
  entity_id: notify.alarm
```

## Number

The KNX number platform allows to send generic numeric values to the KNX bus and update its state from received telegrams. It can optionally respond to read requests from the KNX bus.

<div class='note'>

Number entities without a `state_address` will restore their last known state after Home Assistant was restarted.

Numbers that have a `state_address` configured request their current state from the KNX bus.

</div>

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  number:
    - name: "Duration"
      address: "0/0/1"
      type: time_period_sec
    - name: "Volume"
      address: "0/0/2"
      state_address: "0/0/3"
      type: percent

The KNX scenes platform allows you to trigger [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) scenes. These entities are write-only.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  scene:
    - name: "Romantic"
      address: 8/8/8
      scene_number: 23
```

  description: The [category](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity#generic-properties) of the entity.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: None
{% endconfiguration %}

## Select

The KNX select platform allows the user to define a list of values that can be selected via the frontend and can be used within conditions of automation. When a user selects a new item, the assigned generic raw payload is sent to the KNX bus. A received telegram updates the state of the select entity. It can optionally respond to read requests from the KNX bus.

<div class='note'>

Select entities without a `state_address` will restore their last known state after Home Assistant was restarted.

Selects that have a `state_address` configured request their current state from the KNX bus.

</div>

```yaml

## Sensor

The KNX sensor platform allows you to monitor [KNX](https://www.knx.org/) sensors.

Sensors are read-only. To write to the KNX bus configure a [Number](#number), an exposure [KNX Integration Expose](/integrations/knx/#exposing-entity-states-entity-attributes-or-time-to-knx-bus) or use the `knx.send` service.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  sensor:
    - name: "Heating Valve 1"
      state_address: "2/0/0"
      type: percent
```

In order to actively read the sensor data from the bus every 30 minutes you can add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  sensor:
    - name: "Heating Valve 1"
      state_address: "2/0/0"
      type: percent
      sync_state: every 30

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  sensor:
    - name: "Heating Valve 1"

```

## Switch

The KNX switch platform is used as an interface to switching actuators.

```yaml
knx:
  switch:
    - name: "Kitchen coffee maker"
      address: "1/1/6"
```

{% configuration %}

{% endconfiguration %}

The optional `state_address` can be used to inform Home Assistant about state changes not triggered by a telegram to the `address` e.g., if you configure a timer on a channel. If a KNX message is seen on the bus addressed to the given state address, this will overwrite the state of the switch object.

Switch entities without a `state_address` will restore their last known state after Home Assistant was restarted.
Switches that have a `state_address` configured request their current state from the KNX bus.

## Text

The KNX text platform allows to send text values to the KNX bus and update its state from received telegrams. It can optionally respond to read requests from the KNX bus.

<div class='note'>

Text entities without a `state_address` will restore their last known state after Home Assistant was restarted.

Texts that have a `state_address` configured request their current state from the KNX bus.

</div>

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
knx:
  text:
    - name: "Info"

## Time

The KNX time platform allows to send time values to the KNX bus and update its state from received telegrams. It can optionally respond to read requests from the KNX bus.

<div class='note'>

Time entities without a `state_address` will restore their last known state after Home Assistant was restarted.

Times that have a `state_address` configured request their current state from the KNX bus.

</div>

<div class='note'>

The `day` field of the time telegram will always be set to 0 (`no day`).

## Troubleshooting / Common issues

### Logs for the KNX integration

`xknx`, the library used for KNX communication, provides various logging handlers for monitoring and debug purposes.
Add the following lines to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` to activate them:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    # For most debugging needs `xnx.log` and `xknx.telegram` are a good choice.
    xknx: info  # sets the level of all loggers
    # Loggers for different layers of KNX communication
    xknx.log: debug  # provides general information (connection, etc.)
    xknx.telegram: debug  # logs telegrams before they are being processed or sent
    xknx.cemi: debug  # logs incoming and outgoing CEMI frames
    xknx.data_secure: debug  # logs Data Secure relevant information
    xknx.ip_secure: debug  # logs IP Secure relevant information
    xknx.knx: debug  # logs incoming and outgoing KNX/IP frames
    xknx.raw_socket: warning  # logs incoming UDP/TCP frames in raw hex format at socket level
    # Loggers for xknx internals
    xknx.state_updater: warning  # provides information about the state updater
```

You can use the service `logger.set_level` to change the log level of a handler on a running instance.
{% my developer_call_service badge service="logger.set_level" %}

### Group address can not be read

Every `*_state_address` is read on startup sequentially if not configured differently. If you see the following errors in your log, a group address could not be read by a GroupValueRead request from Home Assistant in time.

```log
> Could not sync group address '1/2/3' (Entity name - Feature)
> Error: KNX bus did not respond in time (2.0 secs) to GroupValueRead request for: '1/2/3'
```

#### No group object (GO) assigned to the group address (GA) has the Read-Flag set in ETS

- Enable the read flag for *one* GO assigned to the GA. Use the one most likely to hold the current state (e.g., for a light entity's `brightness_state_address` the according GO of the dimming actuator).

#### Response telegrams are not passing a line coupler, router or other filter in the installation

- Assign the group addresses used by Home Assistant to the used interface in ETS if your interface application supports that. ETS will generate filter tables that are applied to your line couplers after updating their application.
- If your interface application doesn't support that, use a dummy device in ETS for Home Assistant. These can be found in the ETS online catalog. Assign it to the line your interface connects Home Assistant to and link its group objects to the group addresses you are using in Home Assistant.

#### Unresponsive system

- The timeout for logging the errors (2 seconds) is started when the GroupValueRead request is scheduled to be sent. On systems experiencing high loads sending can be delayed (e.g., Raspberry Pi running lots of integrations at startup).
Incoming response telegrams are always processed, so no information gets lost.

### Duplicate entities

If you find following error in your log you seem to have a duplicated entity in your configuration.

```log
Platform knx does not generate unique IDs. ID 1/2/3 already exists - ignoring platform.name
```

The `unique_id` for KNX entities is generated based on required configuration values.

- binary_sensor: `state_address`
- climate: `temperature_address` `target_temperature_state_address` `target_temperature_address` `setpoint_shift_address`
- cover: `move_long_address` `position_address`
- fan: `address`
- light: `address` or all combined `brightness_address` if only `individual_colors` is used
- notify: `address`
- scene: `address` and `scene_number`
- sensor: `state_address`
- switch: `address`
- weather: `address_temperature`

There can not be multiple entities on the same platform sharing these exact group addresses, even if they differ in other configuration.
