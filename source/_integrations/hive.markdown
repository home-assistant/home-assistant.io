The Hive integration for Home Assistant allows you to interact with supported devices and services offered by
[hivehome.com](https://www.hivehome.com)

{% endnote %}

This Hive integration uses the same username and password you use on the [Hive website](https://sso.hivehome.com) to configure it within Home Assistant, 2FA authentication must be enabled to use this integration. Once configured Home Assistant will detect and add all Hive devices, including support for multi-zone heating.

## Services

### Service `hive.boost_heating_on`

You can use the service `hive.boost_heating_on` to set your heating to boost for a period of time at a certain target temperature". Individual TRVs can also be boosted in the same way, using this service.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | String, Name of entity e.g., `climate.heating`                         |
| `time_period`          | no       | Time Period, Period of time the boost should last for e.g., `01:30:00` |
| `temperature`          | yes      | String, The required target temperature e.g., `20.5`                   |

Examples:

```yaml
# Example script to boost heating, boost period and target temperature specified.
script:
  boost_heating:
    sequence:
      - service: hive.boost_heating_on
        target:
          entity_id: "climate.heating"
        data:
          time_period: "01:30:00"
          temperature: "20.5"
```

### Service `hive.boost_heating_off`

You can use the service `hive.boost_heating_off` to turn your heating boost off.

script:
  boost_heating:
    sequence:
      - service: hive.boost_heating_off
        target:
          entity_id: "climate.heating"
```

### Service `hive.boost_hot_water`
