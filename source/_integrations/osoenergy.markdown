The OSO Energy integration for Home Assistant allows you to interact with supported devices and services offered by [OSO Energy](https://www.osoenergy.no)

This OSO Energy integration uses a subscription key, which a user can create for his account on the [OSO Energy website](https://portal.osoenergy.no/), to configure it within Home Assistant. Once configured Home Assistant will detect and add all OSO Energy devices.

## Services

### Service `osoenergy.get_profile`

You can use the service `osoenergy.get_profile` to get the temperature profile for a water heater. Each temperature corresponds to a given local hour during the current day. For example, a temperature at index 1 corresponds to 01:00 local time.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | String, name of entity. For example: `water_heater.heater` |

Example:

```yaml
# Example script to get the temperature profile of a water heater.
script:
  get_profile:
    sequence:
      - service: osoenergy.get_profile
        target:

## Binary sensors

The **OSO Energy** integration exposes OSO Energy data as a binary sensor. It provides the following binary sensors:

- Extra energy
  - Indication if the water heater is currently in an extra energy/high demand state.
- Power save
  - Indication if the water heater is currently in a power save/sleep mode state.
- Heating
  - Indication if the water heater is currently heating the water.

## Sensors

The **OSO Energy** integration exposes OSO Energy data as a sensor. It provides the following sensors:

- Heater Mode for water heaters.
  - Indication of the current heater mode on the device.
- Optimization Mode for water heaters.
  - Indication of the way heating is managed by the device according to external factors. For example, electricity prices.
- Power load (kW) for water heaters.
  - Indication of the current power load of the water heater - how much energy is currently drawn out of the electricity grid.
- Tapping capacity (kWh) for water heaters.
  - Indication for quantity of energy that is stored and available for use at the moment - the current kWh equivalent capacity of the water heater.
- Capacity mixed water at 40°C (L) for water heaters.
  - Indication of the current quantity of water that can be drained out after mixing the water in the heater with the inlet tap water to produce water at 40°C.
- V40 Min (L) for water heaters.
  - The current minimum allowed quantity of mixed water at 40°C. When the current capacity drops below this threshold, the heater will turn on as a feature to guard against cold water.
- Minimum Level of V40 Min (L) for water heaters.
  - The lower boundary of the V40 Min sensor that can be achieved during normal operation of the water heater. Can vary depending on the type of the heater.
- Maximum Level of V40 Min (L) for water heaters.
  - The upper boundary of the V40 Min sensor that can be achieved during normal operation of the water heater. Can vary depending on the type of the heater.

## Water heater

The OSO Energy water heater integration integrates your OSO Energy devices into Home Assistant.

It supports the following OSO Energy devices:

- Water Heaters
- Sensors
