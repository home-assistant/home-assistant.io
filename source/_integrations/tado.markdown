The Tado integration platform is used as an interface to the [my.tado.com](https://my.tado.com/) website.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary sensor - for some additional information of the zones.
- Climate - for every Tado zone.
- Water heater - for water heater zones.
- [Presence detection](#presence-detection)
- Sensor - for some additional information of the zones.
- Weather - for information about the current weather at the location of your Tado home.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The Tado thermostats are internet connected thermostats. There exists an unofficial API at [my.tado.com](https://my.tado.com/), which is used by their website and now by this component.

It currently supports presenting the current temperature, the setting temperature and the current operation mode. The operation mode can be set to manual, auto and off. If no user is at home anymore, all Tado zones show the away-state (Only with Tado assist mode). Manually switching between home-mode and away-mode is also supported. Manually switching to auto-mode is only supported with Tado assist mode. Any Tado climate card can be switched between these presence modes, this changes the setting for the entire home.

## Presence detection

The Tado device tracker is using the [Tado Smart Thermostat](https://www.tado.com/) and its support for person presence detection based on smartphone location by geofencing.

This tracker uses the Tado API to determine if a mobile device is at home.

By default the Tado device tracker will track all devices known to Tado associated with your home. The Tado app needs to have the `Geolocation` permission enabled for the device to be tracked.

Your device has to be at home at least once before showing up as *home* or *away*.
Polling Tado API for presence information will happen at most once every 30 seconds.

Beware that the Tado (v2) API does not provide GPS location of devices, only a bearing, therefore Home Assistant only uses `home`/`not-home` status.

## Services

### Service `tado.set_climate_timer`

You can use the service `tado.set_climate_timer` to set your Tado climate device, for example a radiator valve, to switch on for a set time period.

```yaml
# Example script to set a timer for the water heater with no temperature specified

      - service: tado.set_climate_timer
        target:
          entity_id: climate.heating
