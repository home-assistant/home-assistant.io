The `google_pubsub` integration allows you to hook into the Home Assistant event bus and send events to [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview). The current [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/) of GCP should allow you to sync about 1 event every 2 seconds on average (2 million invocations per month).

## First time setup

This assumes you already have a Google Cloud project. If you don't, please create one in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

Create a Google Pub/Sub topic in the [Google Cloud API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topicList). The topic name will become something like `projects/project-198373/topics/topic-name`. Note the last part only (the name you chose): `topic-name`.

Next, you need to create a Service Account key in the [Google Cloud API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey)

- Choose a new "New Service Account", give it a name and leave the key type as JSON
- Select the role: Pub/Sub Publisher 

This will download the Service Account JSON key to your machine. Do NOT share this with anyone. Place this file in your Home Assistant configuration folder.

## Configuration

Add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
google_pubsub:
  project_id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  topic_name: YOUR_TOPIC_NAME
  credentials_json: CREDENTIALS_FILENAME
```

{% configuration %}
project_id:
  description: Project ID from the Google console (looks like `words-2ab12`).
  required: true
  type: string
topic_name:
  description: The Pub/Sub [relative](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names) topic name (looks like `hass`).
  required: true
  type: string
credentials_json:
  description: The filename of the Google Service Account JSON file.
  required: true
  type: string
filter:
  description: Filter domains and entities for Google Cloud Pub/Sub. ([Configure Filter](#configure-filter))
  required: true
  type: map
  keys:
    include_domains:
      description: List of domains to include (e.g., `light`).
      required: false
      type: list
    exclude_domains:
      description: List of domains to exclude (e.g., `light`).
      required: false
      type: list
    include_entity_globs:
      description: Include all entities matching a listed pattern (e.g., `sensor.weather_*`).
      required: false
      type: list
    exclude_entity_globs:
      description: Exclude all entities matching a listed pattern (e.g., `sensor.weather_*`).
      required: false
      type: list
    include_entities:
      description: List of entities to include (e.g., `light.attic`).
      required: false
      type: list
    exclude_entities:
      description: List of entities to include (e.g., `light.attic`).
      required: false
      type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

<div class='note warning'>
  Not filtering domains or entities will send every event to Google PubSub, thus hitting the free tier limit very fast. Be sure to fill in this configuration parameter or have a paid subscription for Google Cloud.
</div>

### Configure Filter

By default, no entity will be excluded. To limit which entities are being exposed to `Google Pub/Sub`, you can use the `filter` parameter.

```yaml
# Example filter to include specified domains and exclude specified entities
google_pubsub:
  project_id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  topic_name: YOUR_TOPIC_NAME
  credentials_json: CREDENTIALS_FILENAME
  filter:
    include_domains:
      - alarm_control_panel
      - light
    include_entity_globs:
      - binary_sensor.*_occupancy
    exclude_entities:
      - light.kitchen_light
```

Filters are applied as follows:

1. No includes or excludes - pass all entities
2. Includes, no excludes - only include specified entities
3. Excludes, no includes - only exclude specified entities
4. Both includes and excludes:
   - Include domain and/or glob patterns specified
      - If domain is included, and entity not excluded or match exclude glob pattern, pass
      - If entity matches include glob pattern, and entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
      - If domain is not included, glob pattern does not match, and entity not included, fail
   - Exclude domain and/or glob patterns specified and include does not list domains or glob patterns
      - If domain is excluded and entity not included, fail
      - If entity matches exclude glob pattern and entity not included, fail
      - If entity does not match any exclude criteria (domain, glob pattern or listed), pass
   - Neither include or exclude specifies domains or glob patterns
      - If entity is included, pass (as #2 above)
      - If entity include and exclude, the entity exclude is ignored

### Saving the data using a Google Cloud Function

To save your data automatically to BigQuery, follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/timvancann/home-assistant-pubsub-cloud-function). The current [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/) of GCP should allow to store up to 10GB of data.
