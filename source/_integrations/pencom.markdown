[Pencom Design](https://www.pencomdesign.com/) is a manufacturer of computer-controlled relay, I/O and custom boards for commercial and industrial applications.  This interface to [Pencom's Relay Control Boards](https://www.pencomdesign.com/relay-boards) is designed to work over an ethernet to serial adapter (NPort).  Each switch (relay) can be turned on/off, and the state of the relay can be read.

## Configuration

The Pencom relays can be daisy-chained to allow for up to 8 boards.

``` yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: pencom
    host: host.domain.com
    port: 4001
    boards: 2
    relays:
      - name: "Irrigation"
        addr: 0
      - name: "Upper Entry Door"
        addr: 1
      - name: "Fountain"
        addr: 0
        board: 2
```
