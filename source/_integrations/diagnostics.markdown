The diagnostics {% term integration %} provides a way to download diagnostic data from
a {% term device %} or {% term integration %}, that can be shared in issue reports. Sharing
diagnostics data when reporting an issue allows developers to diagnose 
and fix your reported problem quicker.

Diagnostics data is provided by an integration, and can be downloaded
as a text file on the device page, and from the integrations dashboard.

Integrations are required to redact sensitive information from the diagnostics
data, you can always open the text file and check it, before you send
it in a public issue.

The diagnostics integration is by default enabled, no action is required to
enable it. However, not all integrations provide the possibility to download
diagnostic data.
