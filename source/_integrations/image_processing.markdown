Image processing enables Home Assistant to process images from [cameras](/integrations/#camera). Only camera entities are supported as sources.

{% include integrations/building_block_integration.md %}

## ALPR

ALPR entities have a vehicle counter attribute `vehicles` and all found plates are stored in the `plates` attribute.

The `found_plate` event is triggered after OpenALPR has found a new license plate.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml automation entry
automation:
- alias: "Open garage door"
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: image_processing.found_plate
    event_data:
      entity_id: openalpr.camera_garage_1
      plate: BE2183423
...
```

The following event attributes will be present (platform-dependent): `entity_id`, `plate`, `confidence`

## Face

Face entities have a face counter attribute `total_faces` and all face data is stored in the `faces` attribute.

The `detect_face` event is triggered after a Face entity has found a face.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml automation entry
automation:
- alias: "Known person in front of my door"
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: image_processing.detect_face
    event_data:
      entity_id: image_processing.door
      name: "Hans Maier"
...
```

The following event attributes will be present (platform-dependent): `entity_id`, `name`, `confidence`, `age`, `gender`, `motion`, `glasses`

## scan_interval and optimizing Resources

Image processing integrations process the image from a camera at a fixed period given by the `scan_interval`. This leads to excessive processing if the image on the camera hasn't changed, as the default `scan_interval` is 10 seconds. You can override this by adding to your configuration `scan_interval: 10000` (setting the interval to 10,000 seconds), and then call the `image_processing.scan` service when you actually want to perform processing.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml
sensor:
- platform: _AN_IMAGE_PROCESSING_PLATFORM_
  scan_interval: 10000
...
automation:
- alias: "Scan for faces when motion detected"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.door_motion_sensor
      to: "on"
  action:
    - service: image_processing.scan
      target:
        entity_id: image_processing.door
...
```
