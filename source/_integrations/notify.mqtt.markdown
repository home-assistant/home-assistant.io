The **MQTT notify** platform lets you send an MQTT message when the `send_message` service is called. This can be used to expose a service of a remote device that allows processing a message, such as showing it on a screen.

## Configuration

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - notify:
      command_topic: "home/living_room/status_screen/notifications"
```

## Examples

In this section, you will find some real-life examples of how to use this feature.

### Full configuration

The example below shows a full configuration for a notify entity.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - notify:
      unique_id: living_room_stat_scr01
      name: "Living room status screen"
      command_topic: "home/living_room/status_screen/notifications"
      availability:
        - topic: "home/living_room/status_screen/available"
      qos: 0
      retain: false
```
