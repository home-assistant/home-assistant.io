The `template` {% term integration %} creates alarm control panels that combine integrations or adds preprocessing logic to actions.

There are several powerful ways to use this {% term integration %}, including grouping existing integrations into a simpler integrations, or adding logic that Home Assistant will execute when accessed.

For example, if you want to expose a true alarm panel to Google Home, Alexa, or HomeKit - but limit its ability to disarm when there's no one home, you can do that using a template.

Another use case could be grouping a series of sensors and services together to represent various "armed" and "disarmed" states and actions.

This can simplify the GUI and make it easier to write automations.

In optimistic mode, the alarm control panel will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the alarm control panel will wait for state confirmation from the template. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect operation.

## Configuration

To enable a template alarm control panel in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: template
    panels:
      safe_alarm_panel:
        value_template: "{{ states('alarm_control_panel.real_alarm') }}"
        arm_away:
          service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away
          target:
            entity_id: alarm_control_panel.real_alarm
          data:
            code: !secret alarm_code
        arm_home:
          service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_home
          target:

            state: "home"
          - service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_disarm
            target:
              entity_id: alarm_control_panel.real_alarm
            data:

### Template and action variables

State-based template entities have the special template variable `this` available in their templates and actions. The `this` variable aids [self-referencing](/integrations/template#self-referencing) of an entity's state and attribute in templates and actions.

## Considerations

If you are using the state of an integration that takes extra time to load, the template alarm control panel may get an `unknown` state during startup. This results in error messages in your log file until that integration has completed loading. If you use `is_state()` function in your template, you can avoid this situation.

For example, you would replace {% raw %}`{{ states.switch.source.state == 'on' }}`{% endraw %} with this equivalent that returns `true`/`false` and never gives an unknown result: {% raw %}`{{ is_state('switch.source', 'on') }}`{% endraw %}
