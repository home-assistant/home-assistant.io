The **Bring!** integration allows you to interact with your [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/) shopping lists within Home Assistant.

For authentication, the integration requires the `email` and `password` you used for your Bring! account. If you want to automatically receive notifications via the Bring! app when Home Assistant adds or removes an item from the list, you should use a dedicated account (such as `email:Â your.name+ha@gmail.com`) to connect Home Assistant with [Bring!](https://www.getbring.com/).

## Actions

You can use the actions from the [to-do list](/integrations/todo/) to create, update, or delete items on your Bring! shopping lists.

### Notifications

The **Bring** integration offers an action to send push notifications to the Bring! mobile apps of other members of a shared shopping list. The Bring! mobile app has 4 predefined notification types. Note: If you want to receive these notifications yourself, you need to use a dedicated account as mentioned above.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                                                                                                      |

| `target`               |       no | Target Bring! list(s) whose members should be notified.                                                                          |
| `message`              |       no | Type of push notification to send to list members. See [Notification types](#available-notification-types).                      |
| `item`                 |      yes | **Required for `urgent_message`.** Article name to include in the message. For example: *Urgent Message - Please buy cilantro urgently*. |
