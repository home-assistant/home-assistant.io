The Twinkly integration allows you to control [Twinkly](https://twinkly.com/) LED string from Home Assistant.

## Effects

For devices with software version > 2.7.1, you can also control the effects on your Twinklys.

The Twinkly devices do not initially have any effects stored locally. Effects must be added from the Twinkly application before they become visible in Home Assistant.

Make sure the latest firmware is installed on your Twinkly devices and add effects by _apply_-ing them from the Twinkly app.
This integration can then be used to switch between static colors and effects, and to turn your Twinklys on and off.  

Playlists and Music modes are currently not supported.

_If configured using an IP address, on your router / DHCP, you should assign a static IP to your Twinkly device._
