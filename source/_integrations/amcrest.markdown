The `amcrest` camera platform allows you to integrate your [Amcrest](https://amcrest.com/) or Dahua IP camera or doorbell in Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following {% term device %} types within Home Assistant:

- Binary sensor
- Camera
- Sensor

## Configuration

To enable your camera in your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
amcrest:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD

```

{% endconfiguration %}

**Note:** Amcrest cameras with newer firmware no longer have the ability to
stream `high` definition video with MJPEG encoding. You may need to use `low`
resolution stream or the `snapshot` stream source instead.  If the quality seems
too poor, lower the `Frame Rate (FPS)` and max out the `Bit Rate` settings in
your camera's configuration manager. If you defined the `stream_source` to
`mjpeg`, make sure your camera supports `Basic` HTTP authentication.
Newer Amcrest firmware may not work, then `rtsp` is recommended instead.

**Note:** If you set the `stream_source` option to `rtsp`,
make sure to follow the steps mentioned at [FFmpeg](/integrations/ffmpeg/)
documentation to install the `ffmpeg`.

### Streaming vs polled binary sensors

Some binary sensors provide two choices for method of operation: streaming or polled. Streaming is more responsive and causes less network traffic because the camera will tell Home Assistant when the sensor's state has changed. Polled mode queries the camera periodically (every five seconds) to check the state of the sensor. Therefore streaming is the better option. However, some camera models and versions of camera firmware do not seem to implement the streaming method properly. Therefore the polled mode is also available. It is recommended to use the streaming mode (e.g., `motion_detected`) first, and if that doesn't work (e.g., results in constant errors), then try the polled mode instead (e.g., `motion_detected_polled`.)

## Events

Once loaded, the Amcrest integration will generate (Home Assistant) {% term events %} when it receives event notifications in the stream sent by the camera. This is only possible if the camera model and firmware implement the streaming method (see [above](#streaming-vs-polled-binary-sensors)). The event type is `amcrest` and the data is as follows:

```json
{
  "camera": "<name of the camera that triggered the event>",
  "event": "<amcrest-specific code of the event>",
  "payload": {
    <json-encoded content sent by the device
     through the streaming protocol>
  }
 }
```

The event code is sent by Amcrest or Dahua devices in the payload as a "Code" member. To ease event matching in automations, this code is replicated in a more top-level `event` member in `data`.

## Services

Once loaded, the `amcrest` integration will expose {% term services %} that can be called to perform various actions. The `entity_id` service attribute can specify one or more specific cameras, or `all` can be used to specify all configured Amcrest cameras.

Available {% term services %}:
`enable_audio`, `disable_audio`,
`enable_motion_recording`, `disable_motion_recording`,
`enable_recording`, `disable_recording`,
`goto_preset`, `set_color_bw`,

## Notes

- PTZ zoom capability does not control VariFocal lens adjustments.
- There can be several seconds of lag before the video (snapshot or live) reflects the camera movement.

## Advanced configuration

You can also use this more advanced configuration example:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
amcrest:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA_1
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    binary_sensors:
      - motion_detected
      - crossline_detected
      - online
    sensors:
      - sdcard

  # Add second camera
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA_2
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    name: Amcrest Camera 2
    resolution: low
    stream_source: snapshot
    sensors:
      - ptz_preset
```

## Example automation to detect button presses on AD110 and AD410 doorbells

Using this {% term trigger %} in an {% term automation %} will allow you to detect the press of the doorbell call button and create automations based upon it.

```yaml
# Example automations.yaml entry
alias: Doorbell Pressed
description: "Trigger when Amcrest Button Press Event Fires"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: amcrest
    event_data:
      event: "CallNoAnswered"
      payload:
        action: "Start"
action:
  - type: flash
    entity_id: light.living_room
    domain: light
```
