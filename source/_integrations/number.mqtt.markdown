The `mqtt` Number platform allows you to integrate devices that might expose configuration options through MQTT into Home Assistant as a Number. Every time a message under the `topic` in the configuration is received, the number entity will be updated in Home Assistant and vice-versa, keeping the device and Home Assistant in-sync.

## Configuration

To enable MQTT Number in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  number:
    - command_topic: my-device/threshold
```
<a id='new_format'></a>

{% details "Previous configuration format" %}

The configuration format of manual configured MQTT items has changed.
The old format that places configurations under the `number` platform key
should no longer be used and is deprecated.

The above example shows the new and modern way,
this is the previous/old example:

```yaml
number:
  - platform: mqtt
    command_topic: my-device/threshold
```

Make sure that your topic matches exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.
