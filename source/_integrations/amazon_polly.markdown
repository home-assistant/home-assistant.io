The `amazon_polly` text-to-speech platform that works with [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) to create the spoken output.
Polly is a paid service via Amazon Web Services.  There is a [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/) for the first 12 months and then a charge per million characters afterwards.

## Setup

For more information, please read the [AWS General Reference regarding Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html) to get the needed details. Also, check the [boto3 Documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#shared-credentials-file) about the profiles and the [AWS Regions and Endpoints Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints) for available regions.

Available voices are listed in the [Amazon Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html).

## Usage

Say to all `media_player` device entities:

```yaml
- service: tts.amazon_polly_say
  data:
    message: "<speak>Hello from Amazon Polly</speak>"
```

or

```yaml
- service: tts.amazon_polly_say
  data:
    message: >
      <speak>
          Hello from Amazon Polly
      </speak>
```

Say to the `media_player.living_room` device entity:

```yaml
- service: tts.amazon_polly_say
  target:
    entity_id: media_player.living_room
    message: >
      <speak>
          Hello from Amazon Polly
      </speak>
```

Say with break:

```yaml
- service: tts.amazon_polly_say
  data:
    message: >
      <speak>
          Hello from
          <break time=".9s" />
          Amazon Polly
      </speak>
```
## Advanced usage
Amazon Polly supports accented bilingual voices and you may find that you'd prefer the voice you like be slowed down, or speeded up. If the speed of the voice is a concern, Amazon Polly provides the ability to modify this using SSML tags. First enable SSML in configuration:

```yaml
  - platform: amazon_polly
    ...
    text_type: ssml
    ...
```

Note: You now need to enclose all new and previous TTS input within the `<speak></speak>` tags. To use SSML in automation, you can follow these steps, for instance:

```yaml
service: tts.amazon_polly_say
data:
  cache: true
  entity_id: media_player.mpd
  message: >-
    <speak> <prosody rate="75%">나는  <prosody rate="75%">천천히</prosody> <lang
    xml:lang="fr-FR">parle</lang>.하고 있다식기세척!</speak>
  language: ko-KR
```
