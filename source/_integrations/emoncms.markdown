The `emoncms` sensor {% term integration %} creates sensors for the feeds available in your local or cloud based version of [Emoncms](https://emoncms.org).

To write information from Home Assistant to Emoncms, you can use the [`emoncms_history`](/integrations/emoncms_history) {% term integration %}.

## Prerequisites

 To use this service, you need an Emoncms account and an API key. You can find the API key in your local or cloud-based Emoncms account settings.
