With the **Cloudflare** {% term integration %}, you can keep your Cloudflare DNS records up to date.

The integration runs every hour, but can also be triggered by running the {% my developer_services title="`cloudflare.update_records` service" service="cloudflare.update_records" %}.

## Requirements

The setup requires an API Token created with `Zone:Zone:Read` and `Zone:DNS:Edit` permissions for all zones in your account.

An easy way to create this is to start with the "Edit zone DNS" template then add `Zone:Zone:Read` to the permissions.

## Additional information

This integration uses the whoami service from [home-assistant/services.home-assistant.io](https://github.com/home-assistant/services.home-assistant.io) to set the public IP address.

### Limitations

#### Unusable TLDs

Due to a limitation in the Cloudflare API, you can not use this integration with any of the following TLD's:

- `.cf`
- `.ga`
- `.gq`
- `.ml`
- `.tk`

#### Record types

This integration can only update A records. 

#### Zones

You cannot view which records were selected or view the API Token once the integration is configured.
