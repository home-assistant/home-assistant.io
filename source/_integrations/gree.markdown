There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [`turn on/off`](/integrations/climate#service-climateturn_on)
- [`fan mode`](/integrations/climate#service-climateset_fan_mode)
- [`swing mode`](/integrations/climate#service-climateset_swing_mode)
- [`set_preset_mode`](/integrations/climate#service-climateset_preset_mode)
