The script integration allows users to specify a sequence of actions to be executed by Home Assistant. These are run when you turn the script on. The script integration will create an entity for each script and allow them to be controlled via services.

Scripts can be created via YAML configuration (described below) or via {% my scripts title="the UI" %}.

{% my scripts badge %}

## Configuration

The sequence of actions is specified using the [Home Assistant Script Syntax](/getting-started/scripts/).

{% raw %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
script:
  message_temperature:
    sequence:
      # This is Home Assistant Script Syntax
      - service: notify.notify
        data:
          message: "Current temperature is {{ states('sensor.temperature') }}"
```

{% endraw %}

<div class='note'>

Script names (e.g., `message_temperature` in the example above) are not allowed to contain capital letters, or dash (minus) characters, i.e., `-`. The preferred way to separate words for better readability is to use underscore (`_`) characters.

### Script modes

Mode | Description
-|-
`single` | Do not start a new run. Issue a warning.
`restart` | Start a new run after first stopping previous run.
`queued` | Start a new run after all previous runs complete. Runs are guaranteed to execute in the order they were queued.
`parallel` | Start a new, independent run in parallel with previous runs.

### Passing variables to scripts

As part of the service, variables can be passed along to a script so they become available within templates in that script.

To configure a script to accept variables using the UI, the variables can be added as fields in the script editor.
1. In the script editor, in the 3-dots menu, select **Add fields**.
2. A new section called **Fields** is added between the basic information and **Sequence** sections.
3. Enter a name and choose type and options of each desired field.
4. Fields set up here will be shown in other UI editors, such as in an automation that calls the script as inputs depending on the type of field.
5. To use the field data, use them as templates using the **Field key name** when they were added, as shown in the example below.

Using the variables in the script requires the use of templates:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
script:
  notify_pushover:
    description: "Send a pushover notification"
    fields:
      title:
        description: "The title of the notification"
        example: "State change"
      message:
        description: "The message content"
        example: "The light is on!"
    sequence:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: switch.pushover_notifications
        state: "on"
      - service: notify.pushover
        data:
          title: "{{ title }}"
          message: "{{ message }}"
```
{% endraw %}

Aside from the automation editor UI, variables can be passed to scripts within the service data. This can be used either by calling the script directly or the generic `script.turn_on` service. The difference is described in [Waiting for Script to Complete](#waiting-for-script-to-complete). All service data will be made available as variables in templates, even if not specified as fields in the script. This example shows how to call the script directly:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: light.bedroom
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
  action:
    service: script.notify_pushover
    data:
      title: "State change"
      message: "The light is on!"
```
{% endraw %}

This example shows using `script.turn_on` service:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: light.bedroom
    from: "off"
    to: "on"
  action:
    service: script.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: script.notify_pushover
    data:
      variables:
        title: "State change"
        message: "The light is on!"
```
{% endraw %}



<div class='note'>

Script variables that may be used by templates include the following: 
- those provided from the configuration as fields
- those that are passed as data when started from a service, 
- the `this` variable the value of which is a dictionary of the current script's state.

</div>

### Waiting for Script to Complete

When calling a script "directly" (e.g., `script.NAME`) the calling script will wait for the called script to finish.
If any errors occur that cause the called script to abort, the calling script will be aborted as well.

When calling a script (or multiple scripts) via the `script.turn_on` service the calling script does _not_ wait. It starts the scripts, in the order listed, and continues as soon as the last script is started.
Any errors that occur in the called scripts that cause them to abort will _not_ affect the calling script.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/integrations/script/script_wait.jpg'>
</p>

Following is an example of the calling script not waiting. It performs some other operations while the called script runs "in the background." Then it later waits for the called script to complete via a `wait_template`.
This technique can also be used for the calling script to wait for the called script, but _not_ be aborted if the called script aborts due to errors.

{% raw %}

```yaml
script:
  script_1:
    sequence:
      - service: script.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: script.script_2
      # Perform some other steps here while second script runs...
      # Now wait for called script to complete.
      - wait_template: "{{ is_state('script.script_2', 'off') }}"
      # Now do some other things...
  script_2:
    sequence:
      # Do some things at the same time as the first script...
```

{% endraw %}
