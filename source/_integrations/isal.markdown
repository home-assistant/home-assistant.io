[`zlib`](https://github.com/madler/zlib) is a bottleneck for [`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp), especially for WebSocket connections. [Intelligent Storage Acceleration](https://github.com/intel/isa-l), is used for acceleratingÂ [`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) since it can [speed up](https://github.com/pycompression/python-isal/tree/develop/benchmark_scripts) compression as much as 5x.

## Configuration

Configuration of this integration only applies to Home Assistant Core installations types. Home Assistant Container, Home Assistant Supervisor, and Home Assistant Operation System installs already have `isal` pre-installed, and no action is required.

If your system supports [`isal`](https://github.com/pycompression/python-isal), it can be enabled with the following configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
isal:
```
