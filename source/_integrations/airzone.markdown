This integration interacts with the Local API of [Airzone HVAC zoning systems](https://www.airzone.es/en/).

A typical Airzone device has a *parent zone* (Master Thermostat) per HVAC system, which is the only zone where the HVAC mode can be changed. The rest are *child zones* which can only enable or disable the HVAC and adjust the desired temperature on that specific zone.

Note that multiple HVAC systems can be connected to the same Airzone WebServer. In this case, there will be a *parent zone* per HVAC system and there may also be *child zones* for each HVAC system.

## Binary sensors

For each Airzone system (HVAC machine), the following *binary sensors* are created:

| Condition           | Description                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| problems            | System has errors or warnings.     |

For each Airzone zone (thermostat), the following *binary sensors* are created:

| Condition           | Description                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| air_demand          | HVAC is running.                   |
| battery_low         | Thermostat battery warning.        |
| floor_demand        | Radiating floor is running.        |
| problems            | Zone has errors or warnings.       |

## Climate

For each Airzone zone (thermostat) a *climate entity* is created.

**HVAC mode can only be changed on a *parent zone*.**

*Child zones* can only enable/disable the current HVAC mode selected on the corresponding *parent zone*. Attempting to change the HVAC mode on a *child zone* will result on a Home Assistant error.

## Select

For each Airzone zone (thermostat), the following *selects* are created:

| Condition           | Description                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| Cold Angle          | Grille angle for cooling.          |
| Heat Angle          | Grille angle for heating.          |
| Sleep               | Minutes for auto sleep.            |

## Sensors

For the Airzone DHW, the following *sensors* are created:

| Condition           | Description                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| temperature         | Current DHW temperature.           |

For the Airzone WebServer, the following *sensors* are created:

| Condition           | Description                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| rssi                | WiFi RSSI.                         |

For each Airzone zone (thermostat), the following *sensors* are created:

| Condition           | Description                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| humidity            | Current zone relative humidity.    |
| temperature         | Current zone temperature.          |

## Water heater

For each Airzone device a *water heater entity* is created if supported.
