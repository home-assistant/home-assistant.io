The `nx584` platform provides integration with GE, Caddx, Interlogix (and other brands) alarm panels that support the NX584 interface module (or have it built in). Supported panels include NX4/6/8/8E. Actual integration is done through [pynx584](https://github.com/kk7ds/pynx584) which is required for this to work.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Alarm](#alarm-control-panel)
- [Binary Sensor](#binary-sensor)

## Alarm Control Panel

To enable this, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: nx584
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: The host where the nx584 server process is running.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: localhost
name:
  description: This parameter allows you to override the name.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: NX584
port:
  description: The port where the Alarm panel is listening.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 5007
{% endconfiguration %}

## Binary Sensor

Enabling this binary sensor platform exposes all of your zones as binary sensors, which provides visibility through the UI as well as the ability to trigger automation actions instantly when something happens like a door opening, or a motion sensor trigger.

To enable this feature, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  platform: nx584
```

{% configuration %}
host:
  description: This is the host where the nx584 server process is running. If unset, it is assumed to be `localhost`, which will work if the server process is running on the same system as Home Assistant.
  required: false
  type: string
  default: localhost
port:
  description: The port where the server process is running.
  required: false
  type: integer
  default: 5007
exclude_zones:
  description: This is a list of zone numbers that should be excluded. Use this to avoid exposing a zone that is of no interest, unconnected, etc.
  required: false
  type: [list, integer]
zone_types:
  description: This is a list of zone numbers mapped to zone types. Use this to designate zones as doors, motion sensors, smoke detectors, etc. See the list of available zone types relevant to alarm zones below.
  required: false
  type: list
  keys:
    opening:
      description: Opening
    motion:
      description: Motion
    gas:
      description: Gas
    smoke:
      description: Smoke
    moisture:
      description: Moisture
    safety:
      description: Safety
{% endconfiguration %}

## Full example

An extended configuration entry could look like this:

```yaml
# Full example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  platform: nx584
  host: 192.168.1.10
  port: 5007
  exclude_zones:
    - 3
    - 5
  zone_types:
    1: opening
    2: opening
    4: motion
    6: moisture
```
