### Obtaining the Login User Code

To synchronize device information from the Duwi Smart system to Home Assistant, obtain a login user code by:

1. Using the App Key and Secret with your phone number and password from the application during the login process.
2. Once logged in successfully, the application will display your house information and device details.
3. Synchronize this information to the Home Assistant system, allowing you to control devices in the Duwi Smart
   application directly through Home Assistant.
