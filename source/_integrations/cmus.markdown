The `cmus` platform allows you to control a [cmus](https://cmus.github.io/) music player on a remote or local machine from Home Assistant.

To add cmus to your installation, add the following to your {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

Running it locally will look like:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: cmus
```

If cmus is running on a remote server:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: cmus
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_CMUS_PLAYER
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
