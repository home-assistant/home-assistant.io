The `x10` light platform allows you to control your X10 based lights with Home Assistant.

Requires [Heyu x10](https://www.heyu.org/) and a CM11A or a CM17A "FireCracker" interface.

To enable those lights, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: x10
    devices:
      - id: a2
        name: Guest Room
      - id: a3
        name: Bedroom Lamp
```

{% configuration %}
devices:
