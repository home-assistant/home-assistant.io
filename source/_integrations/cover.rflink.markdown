The `rflink` integration supports devices that use [RFLink gateway firmware](https://www.rflink.nl/download.php), for example the [Nodo RFLink Gateway](https://www.nodo-shop.nl/21-rflink-). RFLink gateway is an Arduino firmware that allows two-way communication with a multitude of RF wireless devices using cheap hardware (Arduino + transceiver).

First, you have to set up your [RFLink hub](/integrations/rflink/).

After configuring the RFLink hub, covers will be automatically discovered and added. Except the Somfy RTS devices.

## Setting up a Somfy RTS device

You have to add the Somfy RTS manually with the supplied RFlinkLoader (Windows only).

Press the Learn button on the original Somfy remote enter the following code within 3 seconds. Your blinds will go up and down shortly:

```text
10;RTS;02FFFF;0412;3;PAIR;
```

Your blinds will go up and down again. This means your RFLink is now paired with your RTS motor.
To check this enter the following code again and see if there is a record.

```text
10;RTSSHOW;
```

```text
RTS Record: 0 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 1 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 2 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 3 Address: 02FFFF RC: 0018
RTS Record: 4 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 5 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 6 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 7 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 8 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 9 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 10 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 11 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 12 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 13 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 14 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
RTS Record: 15 Address: FFFFFF RC: FFFF
```

After configuring the RFLink Somfy RTS you have to add the cover to the `configuration.yaml` file like any other RFlink device.

RFLink cover ID's are composed of: protocol, id, and gateway. For example: `RTS_0100F2_0`.

Once the ID of a cover is known, it can be used to configure the cover in Home Assistant, for example, to add it to a different group or set a nice name.

Configuring devices as a cover:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: rflink
    devices:
      RTS_0100F2_0: {}
      bofumotor_455201_0f: {}
```

          default: False

          required: false

          default: true

          type: [list, string]
        no_group_aliases:
          description: The `aliases` which do not respond to group commands.
          required: false
          type: [list, string]
        type:
          description: The option to invert (`inverted`) on/off commands sent to the RFLink device or not (`standard`).
          required: false
          type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Setting up a KAKU ASUN-650 device

In RFLink, the ON and DOWN command are used to close the cover and the OFF and UP command are used to open the cover. The KAKU (COCO) ASUN-650 works the other way around, it uses the ON command to open the cover and the OFF command to close the cover.

The RFLink cover device has a property named `type` that takes 2 values:

- `standard`: Do not invert the on/off commands sent to the RFLink device.
- `inverted`: Invert the on/off commands sent to the RFLink device.

The following configuration example shows how to use the `type` property:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry that shows how to
# use the type property.
cover:
  - platform: rflink
    devices:
      newkaku_xxxxxxxx_x:
        name: kaku_inverted_by_type
        type: inverted
      newkaku_xxxxxxxx_y:
        name: kaku_not_inverted_by_type
        type: standard
      newkaku_xxxxxxxx_z:
        name: kaku_inverted_by_default
      nonkaku_yyyyyyyy_x:
        name: non_kaku_inverted_by_type
        type: inverted
      nonkaku_yyyyyyyy_y:
        name: non_kaku_not_inverted_by_type
        type: standard
      nonkaku_yyyyyyyy_z:
        name: non_kaku_not_inverted_by_default
```

The configuration above shows that the `type` property may be omitted. When the ID starts with `newkaku`, the integration will make sure that the on and off commands are inverted. When the ID does not start with `newkaku`, the on and off commands are not inverted.

## Setting up a non-RTS cover

Configure `automatic_add` for the light domain (yes, the light domain)
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: rflink
    automatic_add: true
```

When you press the remote buttons, a new light will show up in {% my entities title="the list of entities" %}.

Also you can enable rflink logs and look for the device_id, for example: `dooya_v4_654321_0f` or `brelmotor_3b35c7_47`.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
logger:
  logs:
    rflink: debug
    homeassistant.components.rflink: debug
```

Once the `device_id` is known, the light domain configuration can be removed and configure the device as a cover:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: rflink
    devices:
      dooya_v4_654321_0f:
        name: "Room blinds"
```

## Device support

See [device support](/integrations/rflink/#device-support).

## Additional configuration examples

Multiple covers with custom names and aliases

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: rflink
    devices:
      RTS_0A8720_0:
        name: enanos
        aliases:
          - rts_31e53f_01
          - rts_32e53f_01
      RTS_30E542_0:
        name: comedor
        aliases:
          - rts_33e53f_01
          - rts_fa872e_01
      RTS_33E542_0:
        name: dormitorio
        aliases:
          - rts_30e53f_01
          - rts_32e53f_01
      RTS_32E542_0:
        name: habitaciones
        fire_event: true
```
