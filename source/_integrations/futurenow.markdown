The `futurenow` light platform allows you to use [P5](https://www.p5.hu/) FutureNow relay/dimmer units as lights. Currently supported units: 
* [FutureNow FNIP-6x2AD](https://www.p5.hu/index.php/products/ethernet-modules/265-fnip-6x2ad) dimmer unit (outputs only)
* [FutureNow FNIP-8x10A](https://www.p5.hu/index.php/products/ethernet-modules/263-fnip-8x10a) relay unit (outputs only)

### Configuration Sample

To use your FutureNow units, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: futurenow
    driver: FNIP6x10ad
    host: 192.168.1.101
    port: 7078
    devices:
      5:
        name: Dimmer Channel 5
        dimmable: true
```

{% configuration %}
driver:
  description: "Type of the device. Currently `FNIP6x10ad` or `FNIP8x10a`."
  required: true
  type: string
host:
  description: "The IP address or hostname of your unit, e.g., `192.168.1.101`."

{% endconfiguration %}

### Extended Configuration Sample

The following example `configuration.yaml` has two different FutureNow units with multiple channels:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: futurenow
    driver: FNIP6x10ad
    host: 192.168.1.101
    port: 7078
    devices:
      5:
        name: Dimmer Channel 5
      6:
        name: Dimmer Channel 6
        dimmable: true

  - platform: futurenow
    driver: FNIP8x10a
    host: 192.168.1.102
    port: 7078
    devices:
      1:
        name: Relay Channel 1
