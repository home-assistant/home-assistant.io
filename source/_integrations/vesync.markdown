The `vesync` integration enables you to control smart switches and outlets connected to the VeSync App.

The devices must be added to the VeSync App before this integration can discover them.

The following platforms are supported:

- **light**
- **switch**
- **fan**
- **sensor**

## Prerequisite

Before you can use this integration, all devices must be registered with the
VeSync App. Once registration is complete, continue with the steps described in
the configuration section below.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `update_devices` | Poll Vesync server to find and add any new devices |

## Power & Energy Sensors

Many VeSync outlets support power & energy monitoring. This data is exposed as sensor entities alongside the outlet
itself. Note that prior versions of the integration exposed these as state attributes on the outlet switch entity.

| Sensor                                    | Description                                                             | Example |
| ------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `sensor.<outlet name>_current_power`      | The present power consumption of the switch in watts                    | 7.89    |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_today`   | The kilowatt hours used by the switch during the previous 24 hours      | 0.12    |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_voltage`            | The present voltage of the switch in Volts as a diagnostic sensor       | 120.32  |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_weekly`  | Total energy usage for week starting from Monday 12:01AM in kWh         | 14.74   |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_monthly` | Total energy usage for month starting from 12:01AM on the first in kWh  | 52.30   |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_yearly`  | Total energy usage for year start from 12:01AM on Jan 1 in kWh          | 105.25  |

## Fan & Air Quality Sensors
All VeSync air purifiers expose the remaining filter life, and some also expose air quality measurements.

| Sensor                                  | Description                                                        | Example |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `filter_life`           | Remaining percentage of the filter. (LV-PUR131S, Core200S/300s/400s/600s)         | 142       |
| `air_quality`           | The current air quality reading. (LV-PUR131S, Core300s/400s/600s)                      | excellent |
| `pm2_5`                 | The current air quality reading. (Core300s/400s/600s)                                  | 8         |

## Fan Exposed Attributes

VeSync air purifiers will expose the following details depending on the features supported by the model:

| Attribute               | Description                                                                       | Example         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `mode`                  | The current mode the device is in. (LV-PUR131S, Core200S/300s/400s)               | manual          |
| `speed`                 | The current speed setting of the device. (LV-PUR131S, Core200S/300s/400s)         | high            |
| `speed_list`            | The available list of speeds supported by the device. (LV-PUR131S)                | high            |
| `active_time`           | The number of seconds since the device has been in a non-off mode. (LV-PUR131S)   | 1598            |
| `screen_status`         | The current status of the screen. (LV-PUR131S)                                    | on              |
| `night_light`           | The current status of the night light (Core200S/Core400s)                         | off             |
| `child_lock`            | The current status of the child lock (Core200S/300s/400s)                         | off             |

## Extracting Attribute data

In order to get the attributes readings from supported devices, such as voltage from outlets or fan attributes, you'll have to create a [template sensor](/integrations/template#state-based-template-sensors/).

In the example below, change all of the `vesync_switch`'s to match your device's entity ID.

Adapted from the [TP-Link integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tplink/#plugs).

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Vesync voltage"
      state: "{{ state_attr('switch.vesync_switch', 'voltage') | float(default=0) }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "V"
```
{% endraw %}
