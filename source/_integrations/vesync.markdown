## Prerequisite

Before you can use this {% term integration %}, all devices must be registered with the
VeSync App. Once registration is complete, continue with the steps described in
the configuration section below.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `update_devices` | Poll Vesync server to find and add any new devices |

## Power & energy sensors

Many VeSync outlets support power & energy monitoring. This data is exposed as sensor entities alongside the outlet
itself. Note that prior versions of the {% term integration %} exposed these as state attributes on the outlet switch {% term entity %}.

| Sensor                                    | Description                                                             | Example |
| ------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `sensor.<outlet name>_current_power`      | The present power consumption of the switch in watts                    | 7.89    |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_today`   | The kilowatt hours used by the switch during the previous 24 hours      | 0.12    |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_voltage`            | The present voltage of the switch in Volts as a diagnostic sensor       | 120.32  |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_weekly`  | Total energy usage for week starting from Monday 12:01AM in kWh         | 14.74   |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_monthly` | Total energy usage for month starting from 12:01AM on the first in kWh  | 52.30   |
| `sensor.<outlet name>_energy_use_yearly`  | Total energy usage for year start from 12:01AM on Jan 1 in kWh          | 105.25  |

## Fan & air quality sensors
All VeSync air purifiers expose the remaining filter lifetime, and some also expose air quality measurements.

| Sensor                                  | Description                                                        | Example |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `filter_life`           | Remaining percentage of the filter. (LV-PUR131S, Core200S/300s/400s/600s)         | 142       |
| `air_quality`           | The current air quality reading. (LV-PUR131S, Core300s/400s/600s)                      | excellent |
| `pm2_5`                 | The current air quality reading. (Core300s/400s/600s)                                  | 8         |

## Fan exposed attributes

VeSync air purifiers will expose the following details depending on the features supported by the model:

| Attribute               | Description                                                                       | Example         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `mode`                  | The current mode the device is in. (LV-PUR131S, Core200S/300s/400s)               | manual          |
| `speed`                 | The current speed setting of the device. (LV-PUR131S, Core200S/300s/400s)         | high            |
| `speed_list`            | The available list of speeds supported by the device. (LV-PUR131S)                | high            |
| `active_time`           | The number of seconds since the device has been in a non-off mode. (LV-PUR131S)   | 1598            |
| `screen_status`         | The current status of the screen. (LV-PUR131S)                                    | on              |
| `night_light`           | The current status of the night light (Core200S/Core400s)                         | off             |
| `child_lock`            | The current status of the child lock (Core200S/300s/400s)                         | off             |

## Extracting attribute data

In order to get the attributes readings from supported devices, such as voltage from outlets or fan attributes, you'll have to create a [template sensor](/integrations/template#state-based-template-sensors/).

In the example below, change all of the `vesync_switch`'s to match your device's entity ID.

Adapted from the [TP-Link integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tplink/#plugs).

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Vesync voltage"
      state: "{{ state_attr('switch.vesync_switch', 'voltage') | float(default=0) }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "V"
```

{% endraw %}
