The OpenWeatherMap weather integration uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) as a source for current meteorological data for your location.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Sensor
- Weather

You need an API key, it requires a [subscription](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3). The subscription has a free tier with 1000 calls/day. Consider setting the limit on the OpenWeatherMap website to stay under the threshold where API usage incurs a cost. This is done in the [Billing plans](https://home.openweathermap.org/subscriptions) page, under "Calls per day".

## ⚠️ Important Deprecation Notice

### OpenWeatherMap API V2.5 Deprecation

OpenWeatherMap API V2.5 will be closed on October 7th 2024. After this date, you will need to use API V3.0.

To continue using the service:

- Visit the OpenWeatherMap website and activate the One Call subscription.
- During activation, you will be prompted for a credit card, but you will not be charged unless you exceed the free tier limits.
- Configure your OWM integration to select mode `v3.0`.
- Note: Subscription activation may take up to 2 hours.

For more details, set limits on your usage to avoid charges at [OpenWeatherMap Subscriptions](https://home.openweathermap.org/subscriptions).

{% important %}
If you register an new API key with OpenWeatherMap, it will be activated automatically, this typically takes between 10 minutes and 2 hours
after your successful registration. Keep in mind when configuring this integration, that you new API key might
not be activated yet. Recent policy changes limit the API access for new registered users with a free plan, they should select the `hourly` mode. The other modes require a paid subscription plan. Invalid API-key errors might occur if your API key is used with the other modes.

| Mode      | <li>`v3.0` (new API version) with daily forecast for 8 days, and 1-hour steps for 48 hours</li><li>`v2.5` (deprecated One Call API version), same forcasts as `v3.0`</li><li>`current` (current weather data only, no forecast)</li><li>`forecast` (forecast only, in 3-hour steps for 5 days, no current weather data)</li> |
| Language  | Language for receiving data (only for `sensor`)           |

A `sensor` entity will be created for each supported condition. Their IDs will follow the format:

`sensor.<integration name>_<monitored condition>`

Sensors provide data in the language that was selected when configuring the integration.

{% note %}
The Weather entity provides data only in English. Home Assistant automatically translates it to the language configured for the frontend.

Details about the API are available in the [OpenWeatherMap documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Action `openweathermap.get_minutely_forecasts`

This action populates [response data](/docs/scripts/perform-actions#use-templates-to-handle-response-data)
with a mapping of minute-by-minute (`minutely`) forecasts for the next hour.

**Note:** Minutely forecasts are available only when the OWM integration mode is set to `v3.0`. The action will not be accessible if the mode is set to `current`, `forecast`, or `v2.5`.

```yaml
action: openweathermap.get_minutely_forecasts
response_variable: weather_forecast
```

The response data field is a mapping of `forecast` fields.
`forecast` is a list of 60 forecasted precipitation levels; one for each minute of the next hour:

| Response data | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `datetime` | The time of the forecasted conditions. | 2024-10-19T18:59:00+00:00 |
| `precipitation` | The precipitation amount in mm/h. | 1.25 |
