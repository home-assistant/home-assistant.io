The `nexia` integration allows you to integrate your [Nexia](https://mynexia.com/) (Trane) thermostats or [American Standard](https://asairhome.com/) thermostats into Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Binary sensor](#binary-sensor)
- [Climate](#climate)
- [Sensor](#sensor)
- [Scene](#scene)
- [Switch](#switch)
