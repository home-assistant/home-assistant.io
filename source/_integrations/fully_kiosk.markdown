[Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.fully-kiosk.com) is a powerful kiosk browser for Android devices. It provides a number of features for monitoring and controlling your Android device. This integration gives you access to control your device and view the status in Home Assistant.

## Requirements

This integration requires the Fully Remote Admin feature to be enabled in the Fully Kiosk Browser app. This feature requires the paid Fully Plus license. You can test it out for free, but Fully Kiosk Browser will display a watermark on your device.

You will need the IP address of your device, and the Fully Remote Admin password you set in the Fully Kiosk Browser app.
