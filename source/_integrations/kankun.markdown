The `kankun` switch platform allows you to toggle customized Kankun SP3 Wi-Fi switches. Switches are
modified to include the [json.cgi](https://github.com/homedash/kankun-json/blob/master/cgi-bin/json.cgi)
script to provide an HTTP API.
Details of the necessary modifications were provided on the now dead HomeAutomationForGeeks site,
but fortunately we can still access the information via
[archive.org link](https://web.archive.org/web/20170628063659/http://www.homeautomationforgeeks.com/openhab_http.shtml)
(be sure to install the JSON version of the script as linked above).

## Configuration

To enable it, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
