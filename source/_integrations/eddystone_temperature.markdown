The `eddystone_temperature` sensor platform reads temperature information from Bluetooth LE advertisements transmitted by [Eddystone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddystone_(Google)) beacons. Your beacons must be configured to transmit UID frames (for identification) and TLM frames (for temperature).
All beacons that support the Eddystone protocol, have a temperature sensor and can transmit TLM frames are compatible with this platform. For example [Gimbal](https://store.gimbal.com/collections/beacons/), [Estimote](https://estimote.com/) or [kontakt.io](https://kontakt.io/). For more manufacturers see [this overview](https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone#beacon_manufacturers) by Google.

## Requirements

As this platform uses `bluez` to scan for Bluetooth LE devices **a Linux OS with bluez installed** is required. In addition to that, the `libbluetooth` headers need to be installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
```

Scanning for Bluetooth LE devices also requires special permissions. To grant these to the Python executable execute the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' $(readlink -f $(which python3))
```

To use your Eddystone beacon in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: eddystone_temperature
    bt_device_id: 0  # optional
    beacons:
      living_room:
        namespace: "112233445566778899AA"
        instance: "000000000001"
      kitchen:
        namespace: "112233445566778899AA"
        instance: "000000000002"
```
