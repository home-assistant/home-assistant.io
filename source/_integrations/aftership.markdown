The `aftership` platform allows one to track deliveries by [AfterShip](https://www.aftership.com), a service that supports 490+ couriers worldwide. To use the tracking API functionality, the Essentials plan is required. This plan includes 100 shipments per month. There are various paid-for tiers after that.

The sensor value shows the number of packages that are not in `Delivered` state. As attributes are the number of packages per status.

## Setup

To use this sensor, you need an [AfterShip Account](https://accounts.aftership.com/register) and set up an API Key. To set up an API Key go to [AfterShip API](https://admin.aftership.com/settings/api-keys) page, and copy existing key or generate a new one.

{% important %}
AfterShip removed the Tracking API functionality from the Forever Free plan, and also no longer offers it in the Essentials plan. Using this integration now requires at least the [Pro](https://www.aftership.com/pricing/tracking) plan.
