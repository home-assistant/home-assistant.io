The **VoIP** {% term integration %} enables users to talk to [Assist](/voice_control/) using an analog phone and a VoIP adapter. Currently, the system works with the [Grandstream HT801](https://amzn.to/40k7mRa). See [the tutorial](/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant) for detailed instructions.

As an alternative, the [Grandstream HT802](https://www.amazon.com/Grandstream-GS-HT802-Analog-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B01JH7MYKA/) can be used, which is basically the same as the previously mentioned HT801, but has two phone ports, of which Home Assistant currently support using only one of them.

Also, the Grandstream HT812 has been reported to work. Home Assistant supports using only one of the two phone ports.
