The `w800rf32` component supports W800RF32 devices by [WGL Designs](http://www.wgldesigns.com/w800.html) which 
communicate in the frequency range of 310MHz or if you are outside Canada or the U.S., 433.92 MHz.  

The W800 family of RF receivers are designed to receive X10 RF signals generated from X10 products: Palm Pad 
remotes, key chain remotes, Hawkeye motion detectors, and many, many other X10 RF devices.

To enable W800rf32 in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
w800rf32:
  device: PATH_TO_DEVICE
```

Configuration variables:

- **device** (*Required*): The path to your device, e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`
- **debug** (*Optional*): If you want to receive debug output.
