The `pan_tilt_phat` platform allows you to control a [Pimoroni Pan-Tilt hat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pan-tilt-hat) mounted on the raspberry-pi running Home Assistant. The platform [imports](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pantilthat/0.0.4) the [pantilthat](https://github.com/pimoroni/pantilt-hat) package by Pimoroni. The hat consists of two servos which can pan and tilt a mounted camera with 180 degrees of motion (+/- 90 degrees) along each axis (vertical and horizontal). This documentation assumes you have a [raspberry pi camera](https://home-assistant.io/components/camera.rpi_camera/) mounted on the hat, although other camera brands could be used with some modification to the mounting. The platform adds a sensor which displays the current pan angle (there is currently a bug in the tilt angle)). The platform provides services for setting the angle of each servo, and a service to home the servos to zero degrees on both axes.

To add this platform to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry,
# which is equivalent to the default setup
sensor:
  - platform: pan_tilt_phat
```
### {% linkable_title Service `home_service` %}

Calling this service returns the servos to their home position, pan = tilt = 0 degrees. No service data is required.

### {% linkable_title Service `pan_service` %}

Calling this service changes the pan angle (horizontal plane). The angular range is from -90 to 90 degrees.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `Pan` | no | An integer in the range -90 to 90


### {% linkable_title Service `tilt_service` %}

Calling this service changes the tilt angle (vertical plane). The angular range is from -90 to 90 degrees.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `Tilt` | no | An integer in the range -90 to 90


### {% linkable_title Optional `input_slider & camera configuration` %}

To add the [raspberry pi camera](https://home-assistant.io/components/camera.rpi_camera/) (in the correct orientation for the mount position on the hat) and [input_sliders](https://home-assistant.io/components/input_slider/) to control the pan and tilt servos via the Home Assistant front end, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: rpi_camera
    vertical_flip: 1

input_slider:
  pan_control:
    name: Pan
    initial: 0
    min: -90
    max: 90
    step: 1
  tilt_control:
    name: Tilt
    initial: 0
    min: -90
    max: 90
    step: 1
```
Two automations should be created for controlling the pan/tilt using input sliders; one each to call the pan/tilt service when there is a state change of the pan/tilt input_slider. The automation could be written in yaml, or alternatively a [python_script](https://home-assistant.io/components/python_script/) could be used, with an example for the pan angle (saved in `pan_slider.py`) given below:

```python
entity_id = 'input_slider.pan_control'
slider_value = int(float(hass.states.get(entity_id).state))
hass.services.call('pan_tilt_phat', 'pan', {"Pan":slider_value})
```
The automation to trigger this service (created using the automations editor, and noting that 'id' is generated by the editor) is:

```yaml
- action:
  - data: {}
    service: python_script.pan_slider
  alias: Pan Automation
  condition: []
  id: 'your_id'
  trigger:
  - entity_id: input_slider.pan_control
    platform: state
```
Create a complementary script and automation for the tilt servo, by replacing 'pan' with 'tilt' as required.

Finally, the approach of using an automation to trigger a python_script can be used to ensure that the input_slider values are updated when the pan/tilt angle changes (e.g. due to homing or an automation). The python_script to set the pan angle input_slider is saved in `input_slider_control.py` and given below (UPDATE WHEN TILT ANGLE BUG FIXED):

```python
entity_id = 'sensor.pan_tilt_phat'
state = hass.states.get(entity_id).state   # Pan: angle
pan_angle = state.split(':')[1]           # Gets the angle
logger.warning("pan_angle {}".format(pan_angle))

hass.services.call('input_slider', 'select_value',
    {"entity_id":"input_slider.pan_control", "value": str(pan_angle)})
```
Again using the automations editor, create an automation to trigger `input_slider_control.py` on a state change of `sensor.pan_tilt_phat` (which displays the pan/tilt angle). The automation required is:

```yaml
- action:
  - service: python_script.input_slider_control
  alias: Slider Automation
  condition: []
  id: 'your_id'
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.pan_tilt_phat
    platform: state
```
