The `lupusec` security control panel platform allows you to control your [Lupusec](https://www.lupus-electronics.de) devices.

This component will automatically add `Power Switches` configured in your Lupusec control panel.

For the switches to work you have to setup your [`lupusec` component](/components/lupusec/).
