The `bmw_connected_drive` platform allows you to import data on your BMW into Home Assistant.

The lock will be automatically configured if 'bmw_connected_drive' component is configured.

For more configuration information see the [bmw_connected_drive component](/components/bmw_connected_drive/) documentation.
