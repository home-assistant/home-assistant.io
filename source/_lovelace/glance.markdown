Glance cards are very compact. Very useful to group together multiple sensors for a quick and easy overview. Keep in mind that this can be used together with [entity-filter](/lovelace/entity-filter/) cards to create dynamic cards.

{% configuration %}
type:
  required: true
  description: glance
  type: string
entities:
  required: true
  description: "A list of entity IDs or `entity` objects, see below."
  type: list

{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Options For Entities %}

If you define entities as objects instead of strings, you can add more customization and configuration:

{% configuration %}
entity:
  required: true
  description: Home Assistant entity ID.
  type: string
name:
  required: false
  description: Overwrites friendly name.
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## {% linkable_title Examples %}

Basic example:

```yaml
- type: glance
  title: Glance card sample
  entities:
    - binary_sensor.movement_backyard
    - light.bed_light
    - binary_sensor.basement_floor_wet
    - sensor.outside_temperature
    - light.ceiling_lights
    - switch.ac
    - lock.kitchen_door
```

Define entities as objects and apply a custom name:

```yaml
- type: glance
  title: Better names
  entities:
    - entity: binary_sensor.movement_backyard
      name: Movement?
    - light.bed_light
    - binary_sensor.basement_floor_wet
    - sensor.outside_temperature
    - light.ceiling_lights
    - switch.ac
    - lock.kitchen_door
```
