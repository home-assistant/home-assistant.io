The picture glance card shows an image and lets you place small icons of entity states on top of that card to control those entities from there. In the image below: the entities on the right allow toggle actions, the others show the more information dialog.

### How to use state_filter

Specify different [CSS filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter)

```yaml
state_filter:
  "on": brightness(110%) saturate(1.2)
  "off": brightness(50%) hue-rotate(45deg)
entity: switch.decorative_lights
```

### Examples

This section lists a few examples of how the picture glance card can be used.

### Creating a card to control the camera

If your camera supports <abbr title="pan, tilt, and zoom">PTZ</abbr> (can be moved in different directions), you can use the picture glance card to control the camera.

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/dashboards/picture_glance_camera_control.gif' alt='Picture glance card to control the camera'>
  Picture glance card to control the camera.
</p>

1. Select your camera entity.
    - **Image path** and **Image entity** are not required.
    ![Select camera entity](/images/dashboards/picture_glance_card_select_camera_entity.png)
2. If you want something to happen when you tap the card itself, define a tap action.
   - Here, we toggle a light.
   ![Select camera entity](/images/dashboards/picture_glance_card_define_tap_action.png)
3. Select the entities to move the camera left, right, up, or down.
   ![Select camera entity](/images/dashboards/picture_glance_card_select_camera_arrows.png)
4. Select **Show code editor**.
5. For each of the entities, specify an icon, as indicated in the YAML example.
6. For the buttons to react on press (instead of bringing up the dialog):
   - For each of the entities, under `tap_action`, use a `button.press` action.

    ```yaml
    camera_view: live
    type: picture-glance
    title: Desk
    entities:
      - entity: button.camera1_ptz_left
        icon: mdi:pan-left
        tap_action:
          action: perform-action
          perform_action: button.press
          data:
            entity_id: button.camera1_ptz_left
      - entity: button.camera1_ptz_right
        icon: mdi:pan-right
        tap_action:
          action: perform-action
          perform_action: button.press
          data:
            entity_id: button.camera1_ptz_right
      - entity: button.camera1_ptz_up
        icon: mdi:pan-up
        tap_action:
          action: perform-action
          perform_action: button.press
          data:
            entity_id: button.camera1_ptz_up
      - entity: button.camera1_ptz_down
        icon: mdi:pan-down
        tap_action:
          action: perform-action
          perform_action: button.press
          data:
            entity_id: button.camera1_ptz_down
    camera_image: camera.camera1_sub
    tap_action:
      action: perform-action
      perform_action: light.toggle
      target:
        entity_id: light.philips_929003052501_01_huelight
    ```
7. That's it. You can now control your camera from the picture glance card on your dashboard.

### More examples

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Living room
entities:
  - switch.decorative_lights
  - light.ceiling_lights
  - lock.front_door
  - binary_sensor.movement_backyard
  - binary_sensor.basement_floor_wet
image: /local/living_room.png
```

Display a camera image as background:

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Living room
entities:
  - switch.decorative_lights
  - light.ceiling_lights
camera_image: camera.demo_camera
```

Display a camera image without additional entities:

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Front garden
entities: []
camera_image: camera.front_garden_camera
```

Use different images based on entity state:

```yaml
type: picture-glance
title: Living room
entities:
  - switch.decorative_lights
  - light.ceiling_lights
state_image:
  "on": /local/living_room_on.png
  "off": /local/living_room_off.png
entity: group.living.room
```
