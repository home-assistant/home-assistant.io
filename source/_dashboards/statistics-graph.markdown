The statistics graph card allows you to display a graph of statistics data for each of the entities listed.

Statistics are gathered every 5 minutes and also hourly for sensors that support it. The 5-minute statistics will be retained for the duration set in the [recorder configuration](/integrations/recorder/#purge_keep_days), and hourly statistics will be retained indefinitely. It will either keep the <abbr title="Minimum">`min`</abbr>, <abbr title="Maximum">`max`</abbr>, and <abbr title="Average">`mean`</abbr> of a sensor's value for a specific hour or the <abbr title="Total">`sum`</abbr> for a metered entity.

If your sensor doesn't work with statistics, check [this](/more-info/statistics/).
