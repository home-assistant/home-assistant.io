The sections view lets you organize your cards in sections on a grid.
You can group cards without using horizontal or vertical stack cards.

## Creating a sections view

2. [Add a new view](/dashboards/views/#adding-a-view-to-a-dashboard) and under **View type**, select **Sections**.
3. Select the number of columns you want to see in the new view. Select **Save**.
4. To add a card, select the **Add card** button.
   - Follow the [steps on adding cards](/dashboards/cards/#adding-cards-to-your-dashboard).

5. To add a section, select the **Create section** button.
6. To edit the section title, select the <img height="28px" src="/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/mdi-edit.png" alt="Edit icon"/> button.
   - If you leave the section title empty, this line will be hidden.
7. To delete a section, select the <img height="28px" src="/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/mdi-trash.png" alt="Delete icon"/> button.

## Rearranging sections and cards

In the sections view, you can rearrange sections and cards by dragging them to a new location. This is not yet possible in other views.

1. To edit your dashboard, in the top right corner, select the pencil icon.
2. To rearrange sections, hold the <img height="28px" src="/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/mdi-move.png" alt="Move icon"/> button and move the card.
