The sections view lets you organize your cards in sections on a grid.
It allows you to group card directly in sections, without having to use horizontal or vertical stack cards.

There are a few options to rearrange cards. You can move cards within the section, 
move them from one section into another or even move the entire section.
You can also copy and paste cards.

To see how it works, check out the demo:
