The sections view lets you organize your cards in sections on a grid.
You can group cards without using horizontal or vertical stack cards.

{% note %}
The sections view was released beginning of March 2024 and is experimental! Do not build your daily dashboard on top of it yet! We are still collecting feedback.<br>
It is not possible to migrate dashboards into sections view.
{% endnote %}

## Creating a sections view

1. If you have multiple dashboards, in the left sidebar, select the dashboard to which you want to add the sections view.
2. Follow the steps on [adding a new view](/dashboards/views/#adding-a-view-to-a-dashboard).
   - Under **View type**, select **Sections (experimental)**.
3. Under **Max number of sections wide**, select the maximum number of columns you want to see in the new sections view.
4. Under **Dense section placement**, select if you want to allow the cards to be arranged automatically in order to fill gaps between cards.
   - This will remove some gaps, but it also means you have less control over the order of the cards.
5. When you are done, select **Save**.
   - You are now presented with a new, empty view.
   - If you chose a background image, the page is filled with that image.

## Adding sections and cards to a sections view

Once you have created a sections view, you can populate it with sections and cards. The new section comes with one section to which you can directly add a card.

1. To add a card, select the **Add card** button.
   - Follow the [steps on adding cards](/dashboards/cards/#adding-cards-to-your-dashboard).

2. To add a new section, select the **Create section** button.
3. A [heading card](/dashboards/heading) will be automatically added to the top of the section.
   - To edit it, select the card.
   - If you don't want a heading title at the top of the section, delete this card.
   - The title can be added again later, like any other card.
4. If you want this section to be visible only to specific users or under a certain condition, you can define those conditions:
   - On the **Visibility** tab, select **Add condition**.
   - Select the type of condition, and enter the parameters.
   - If you define multiple conditions, the section is only shown when all conditions are met.
   - If you did not define any conditions, the section is always shown, to all users.

## Deleting a section

1. To delete a section, go to the dashboard and in the top right corner, select the edit {% icon "mdi:edit" %} button.
2. Open the view with the section you want to delete.
3. Select the delete {% icon "mdi:trash" %} button.

## Rearranging sections and cards

In the sections view, you can rearrange sections and cards by dragging them to a new location. This is not yet possible in other views.

1. To edit your dashboard, in the top right corner, select the edit {% icon "mdi:edit" %} button.
2. To rearrange sections, hold the move {% icon "mdi:cursor-move" %} button and move the card.

## Show or hide section conditionally

You can choose to show or hide certain sections based on different conditions. The [available conditions](/dashboards/conditional/#card-conditions) are the same as that for the conditional card.

To edit the section visibility conditions, select the edit {% icon "mdi:edit" %} button and then click on the visibility tab.
