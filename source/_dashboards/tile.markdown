## Available colors

You want to colorize the tile card? Choose one of the following colors: `primary`, `accent`, `disabled`, `red`, `pink`, `purple`, `deep-purple`, `indigo`, `blue`, `light-blue`, `cyan`, `teal`, `green`, `light-green`, `lime`, `yellow`, `amber`, `orange`, `deep-orange`, `brown`, `grey`, `blue-grey`, `black` and `white`.

## Reordering features

Some features of the tile card, such as the presets or the HVAC modes of a
thermostat, can show many buttons. While you can limit the buttons youâ€™d
like to see, they may not be in the desired order.

For your thermostat, that means you can reorder the HVAC modes or presets.
