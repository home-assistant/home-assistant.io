### Examples

Basic example:

```yaml
type: button
entity: light.living_room
```

Button card with a button name and a [script](/docs/scripts/) that runs when card is tapped:

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/dashboards/entity_button_complex_card.png' alt='Screenshot of the Button card with script action'>
Screenshot of the button card with script action.
</p>

```yaml
type: button
name: Turn Off Lights
show_state: false
tap_action:
  action: perform-action
  perform_action: script.turn_on
  data:
    entity_id: script.turn_off_lights
```

Example of 4 buttons on a vertical stack card:

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/dashboards/buttons_on_vertical_stack_card.png' alt='Screenshot of a vertical stack card with 4 buttons and an entity selector'>
Screenshot of a vertical stack card with 4 buttons and an entity selector.
</p>

The image shows a vertical stack card with 4 buttons arranged in a horizontal stack card and an entity selector. The buttons use the toggle action to run a script, for example, the Netflix script, which starts up the TV and opens Netflix. To learn how to create scripts, refer to [scripts](/docs/scripts/).

```yaml
cards:
  - entities:
      - entity: input_select.living_room_scene
        name: Scene
    show_header_toggle: false
    type: entities
  - type: horizontal-stack
    cards:
      - name: Watch Netflix
        entity: script.netflix
        type: button
        tap_action:
          action: toggle
        hold_action:
          action: more-info
        show_name: true
        show_icon: true
      - name: Watch YouTube
        entity: script.youtube
        type: button
        tap_action:
          action: toggle
        hold_action:
          action: more-info
        show_name: true
        show_icon: true
      - name: Wake PC
        entity: script.wake_on_lan
        type: button
        tap_action:
          action: toggle
        icon: mdi:desktop-tower
        show_name: true
        show_icon: true
        show_state: false
      - name: Go to sleep
