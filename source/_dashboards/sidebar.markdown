You can set if a card should be placed in the main (left) column of the sidebar column (right), by selecting the arrow right or left arrow in the bar underneath the card.

On mobile, all cards are rendered in 1 column and kept in the order of the cards in the config.

## View config:

{% configuration %}
type:
  required: true
  description: "`sidebar`"
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

## Cards config:

{% configuration %}
view_layout.position:
  required: false
  description: "The position of the card, `main` or `sidebar`"
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### Example

The position of the card is configured using YAML with the `view_layout` option:

```yaml
type: sidebar
cards:
  - type: entities
    entities: 
      - media_player.lounge_room
    view_layout:
      position: sidebar
```
