The entity filter card allows you to define a list of entities that you want to track only when in a certain state. Very useful for showing lights that you forgot to turn off or show a list of people only when they're at home.

This type of card can also be used together with other cards that allow multiple entities, allowing you to use [glance](/dashboards/glance/) or [picture-glance](/dashboards/picture-glance/). By default, it uses the [entities](/dashboards/entities/) card model.

{% include dashboard/edit_dashboard.md %}

## YAML configuration

  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

*only one filter will be applied: `conditions` or `state_filter` if `conditions` is not present

## Conditions options

You can specify multiple `conditions`, in which case the entity will be displayed if it matches every condition.

### State

Tests if an entity has a specified state.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - climate.thermostat_living_room
  - climate.thermostat_bed_room
conditions:
  - condition: state
    state: heat
```

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - climate.thermostat_living_room
  - climate.thermostat_bed_room
conditions:
  - condition: state
    state_not: "off"
```

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - sensor.gas_station_1
  - sensor.gas_station_2
  - sensor.gas_station_3
conditions:
  - condition: state
    state: sensor.gas_station_lowest_price
```

{% configuration condition_state %}
condition:
  required: true
  description: "`state`"
  type: string
state:
  required: false
  description: Entity state or ID to be equal to this value. Can contain an array of states.*
  type: [list, string]
state_not:
  required: false
  description: Entity state or ID to not be equal to this value. Can contain an array of states.*
  type: [list, string]
{% endconfiguration %}

*one is required (`state` or `state_not`)

### Numeric state

Tests if an entity state matches the thresholds.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - sensor.living_room_temperature
  - sensor.bed_room_temperature
conditions:
  - condition: numeric_state
    above: 10
    below: 20
```

{% configuration condition_numeric_state %}
condition:
  required: true
  description: "`numeric_state`"
  type: string
above:
  required: false
  description: Entity state or ID to be above this value.*
  type: string
below:
  required: false
  description: Entity state or ID to be below this value.*
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

*at least one is required (`above` or `below`), both are also possible for values between.

### Screen

Specify the visibility of the entity per screen size. Some screen size presets are available in the UI but you can use any CSS media query you want in YAML.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - sensor.living_room_temperature
  - sensor.bed_room_temperature
conditions:
  - condition: screen
    media_query: "(min-width: 1280px)"
```

{% configuration condition_screen %}
condition:
  required: true
  description: "`screen`"
  type: string
media_query:
  required: true
  description: Media query to check which screen size are allowed to display the entity.
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

### User

Specify the visibility of the entity per user.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - sensor.living_room_temperature
  - sensor.bed_room_temperature
conditions:
  - condition: user
    users:
      - 581fca7fdc014b8b894519cc531f9a04
```

{% configuration condition_user %}
condition:
  required: true
  description: "`user`"
  type: string
users:
  required: true
  description: User ID that can see the entity (unique hex value found on the Users configuration page).
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

### And

Specify that both conditions must be met.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - sensor.living_room_temperature
  - sensor.bed_room_temperature
conditions:
  - condition: and
    conditions:
      - condition: numeric_state
        above: 0
      - condition: user
        users:
          - 581fca7fdc014b8b894519cc531f9a04
```

{% configuration condition_and %}
condition:
  required: true
  description: "`and`"
  type: string
conditions:
  required: false
  description: List of conditions to check. See [available conditions](#conditions-options).
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

### Or

Specify that at least one of the conditions must be met.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - sensor.outside_temperature
  - sensor.living_room_temperature
  - sensor.bed_room_temperature
conditions:
  - condition: or
    conditions:
      - condition: numeric_state
        above: 0
      - condition: user
        users:
          - 581fca7fdc014b8b894519cc531f9a04
```

{% configuration condition_or %}
condition:
  required: true
  description: "`or`"
  type: string
conditions:
  required: false
  description: List of conditions to check. See [available conditions](#conditions-options).
  type: list
{% endconfiguration %}

## Legacy state filters

### String filter

Show only active switches or lights in the house.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - entity: light.bed_light
    name: Bed
  - light.kitchen_lights
  - light.ceiling_lights
state_filter:
  - "on"
```

Show only people that are at home using [glance](/dashboards/glance/):

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - device_tracker.demo_paulus
  - device_tracker.demo_anne_therese
  - device_tracker.demo_home_boy
state_filter:
  - home
card:
  type: glance
  title: People at home
```

<p class='img'>
  <img src='/images/dashboards/entity_filter_glance.png' alt='Entity filter combined with glance card'>
  Entity filter combined with glance card.
</p>

You can also specify multiple `state_filter` conditions, in which case the entity will be displayed if it matches any condition.

If you define `state_filter` as objects instead of strings, you can add more customization to your filter, as described below.

### Operator filter

Tests if an entity state correspond to the applied `operator`.

{% configuration condition_operator %}
value:
  required: true
  description: String representing the state.
  type: string
operator:
  required: true
  description: Operator to use in the comparison. Can be `==`, `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`, `!=`, `in`, `not in`, or `regex`.
  type: string
attribute:
  required: false
  description: Attribute of the entity to use instead of the state.
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

#### Examples

Displays everyone who is at home or at work.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
entities:
  - device_tracker.demo_paulus
  - device_tracker.demo_anne_therese
  - device_tracker.demo_home_boy
state_filter:
  - operator: "=="
    value: home
  - operator: "=="
    value: work
card:
  type: glance
  title: Who's at work or home
```

Specify filter for a single entity.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
state_filter:
  - "on"
  - operator: ">"
    value: 90
entities:
  - sensor.water_leak
  - sensor.outside_temp
  - entity: sensor.humidity_and_temp
    state_filter:
      - operator: ">"
        value: 50
        attribute: humidity
```

Use a regex filter against entity attributes. This regex filter below looks for expressions that are 1 digit in length and where the number is between 0-7 (so show holidays today or in the next 7 days) and displays those holidays as entities in the Entity Filter card.

```yaml
type: entity-filter
card:
  title: "Upcoming Holidays In Next 7 Days"
  show_header_toggle: false
state_filter:
  - operator: regex
    value: "^([0-7]{1})$"
    attribute: eta
entities:
  - entity: sensor.upcoming_ical_holidays_0
  - entity: sensor.upcoming_ical_holidays_1
  - entity: sensor.upcoming_ical_holidays_2
  - entity: sensor.upcoming_ical_holidays_3
  - entity: sensor.upcoming_ical_holidays_4
show_empty: false
```
