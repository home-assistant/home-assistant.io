The picture elements card is one of the most versatile types of cards.

The cards allow you to position icons or text and even buttons on an image based on coordinates. Imagine floor plan, imagine [picture-glance](/dashboards/picture-glance/) with no restrictions!

## Notes on element attributes

### How to use the style object

Position and style your elements using [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). More/other keys are also possible.
Note, the default style for most elements includes [translate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translate)(-50%, -50%), which means that the coordinates you provide will set the position of the center of the element. Use `transform: none` to disable this behavior.

```yaml
style:
  # Positioning of the element
  left: 50%
  top: 50%
```

### How to use state_image

Specify a different image to display based on the state of the entity.

```yaml
state_image:
  "on": /local/living_room_on.jpg
  "off": /local/living_room_off.jpg
```

### How to use state_filter

Specify different [CSS filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter)

```yaml
state_filter:
  "on": brightness(110%) saturate(1.2)
  "off": brightness(50%) hue-rotate(45deg)
```

### How to use click-and-hold

If the option `hold_action` is specified, that action will be performed when the entity is clicked and held for half a second or more.

```yaml
tap_action:
  action: toggle
hold_action:
  action: perform-action
  perform_action: light.turn_on
  data:
    entity_id: light.bed_light
    brightness_pct: 100
```
