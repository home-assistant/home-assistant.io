This view doesn't have support for badges.

This view is good when using cards like [map](/dashboards/map/), [horizontal stack](/dashboards/horizontal-stack/), [vertical stack](/dashboards/vertical-stack/), [picture elements](/dashboards/picture-elements/), or [picture glance](/dashboards/picture-glance/).
