## Adding a to-do list card

1. [Add the card using the Add card button](/dashboards/cards/#adding-cards-to-your-dashboard).
   - In the **By card** dialog, select the **To-do list** card.
2. In the **Entity** dropdown menu, select your list type.
   - If it is your first time working with to-do lists, there is only **Shopping list** in the menu.
   - This comes from the [shopping list integration](/integrations/shopping_list/), which is installed by default.
   - This is the same **Shopping list** as the one on the **To-do list** dashboard (accessible via sidebar).

3. The to-do list card can display lists from different [to-do list](/integrations/#to-do-list) integrations, such as **Bring!** or **Todoist**.
   - If you don't see your desired to-do list entity, you need to add its integration first.
   - Once you've added a to-do list integration, the lists are also available on the to-do list dashboard.
