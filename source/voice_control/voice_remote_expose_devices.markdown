To be able to control your devices over a voice command, you must expose your entities to Assist.
This is to avoid that sensitive devices, such as locks and garage doors, can inadvertently be controlled by voice commands.

## Exposing your devices to Assist

1. Go to **Settings** > **Voice assistants**.
2. Open the **Expose** tab.
