## Assist on your phone

The easiest way to get started with Assist is by using it on your phone.

- Inside the Home Assistant app in the top-right corner, select the Assist icon.
- On Apple devices via [Siri and Assist shortcuts](/voice_control/apple).
- On Android phones as the default [digital assistant or home screen shortcut](/voice_control/android).
- On a tablet in kiosk mode, you can use a [dashboard button](/voice_control/start_assist_from_dashboard/) to start Assist.

## Voice assistant devices using Assist

Voice assistant devices allow you to add Assist to a room and respond to wake words. Follow our tutorial to [create your own for just $13.](/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/)

## Assist on your analog phone

If you are interested in a voice assistant that is not always listening, consider using Assist on an analog phone. It will only listen when you pick up the horn, and the responses are for your ears only. Follow our tutorial to create your own [analog phone voice assistant](/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/).

## Custom wake words

Wake words allow you to activate Assist by saying an activation phrase instead of pressing a button. [Learn how to configure a wake word.](/voice_control/install_wake_word_add_on). There are predefined wake words, such as "OK Nabu", but you can also [define your own wake word](/voice_control/create_wake_word/)

## Create an assistant with an OpenAI personality

Want to talk to Super Mario? Or another figure? If you want Assist to respond in a fun way, you can create an assistant with an [OpenAI personality](/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/).

Did Assist not understand your sentence? [Contribute them](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/).
