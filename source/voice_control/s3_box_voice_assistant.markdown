## Checking wake word settings

1. Make sure your assistant has [wake word enabled](/voice_control/install_wake_word_add_on/), using "OK Nabu".
2. Under **Devices**, on the ESP32-S3-BOX* entry, select **Device** to open the device page.
3. Check the device settings:
    - If you want, you can process the wake word on the ESP32-S3 device, rather than on your Home Assistant server.   (The server is the device where Home Assistant is installed, for example on Home Assistant Green):
    - Under **Wake word engine location**, select **On device**, if you want your wake word to be processed on the device itself, and not in Home Assistant.
      - Local processing is faster.
      - The wake word is now *Okay Nabu*.

      ![ESP32-S3-BOX-3 on device wake word processing](/images/assist/wake_word_engine_location.png)

4. If you chose on-device wake word, but you do not want to use *Okay Nabu*, you can change the on-device wake word.
   - Currently, *Hey Jarvis* or *Alexa* are the supported alternatives.
   - To change your wake word, follow the steps in [Customizing the S3-BOX-3 with on-device wake words](/voice_control/s3-box-customize/#customizing-on-device-wake-words-microwakeword).
5. Congratulations! You can now voice control Home Assistant via a ESP32 device with a display. Now give some commands.

## Controlling Home Assistant

1. Say your wake word. For this tutorial, use "OK Nabu".
2. Say a [supported voice command](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn on the light*.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.
      - Make sure you’re using the area name exactly as you defined it in Home Assistant.
      - You can also ask a question, such as
          - *Is the front door locked?*
          - *Which lights are on in the living room?*
3. Your command is not supported? Add your own commands using [a sentence trigger](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).

## Turning off microphone or screen

1. If you do not want to Assist to listen to you for a while, you can turn off the microphone.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
      - Under **ESP32-S3-BOX-3**, select **1 device**.
      - Enable **Mute**.
      - The screen of the ESP32-S3-BOX-3 will turn off, too.

      ![Toggle to enable/disable Mute](/images/assist/wake_word_disable.png)
2. If you want to just use the wake word, but do not want to use the screen, you can turn it off.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
     - Under **ESP32-S3-BOX-3**, select **1 device**.
     - Disable **Screen**.

      ![Toggle to enable/disable wake word](/images/assist/s3-box-disable-screen.png)

## Updating the software on the S3-BOX

To update the software on your S3-BOX, follow the steps below that reflect your setup.

- **Option 1**: You have Home Assistant 2024.7 or later, and have not manually altered your ESPHome configuration for the S3-BOX:
  - Once an update is available, you will receive an update notification, just like any other update.
  - To install the precompiled new firmware directly on your box, make sure the S3-BOX is connected to your network, and under **ESP32 S3 BOX...Firmware**, select **Install**.
- **Option 2**: You have Home Assistant 2024.6 or older, and have not manually altered your ESPHome configuration for the S3-BOX:
  - Follow steps 1-3 of the procedure on [installing the software onto the S3-BOX](#installing-the-software-onto-the-esp32-s3-box).
    - This installs the latest, precompiled firmware for your S3-BOX.
- **Option 3**: You have manually changed the configuration file for your S3-BOX:
  - You need to compile your own firmware. To do so, either:
    - Use the ESPHome dashboard add-on within Home Assistant. While the easiest option, it tends to be the slowest and may fail, particularly on older systems or on systems with limited memory/CPU resources.
    - Follow the steps in the [ESPHome documentation](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line) and use a desktop-class system to compile and install the firmware. Initial setup is more complex, but the process is significantly faster and more reliable.
