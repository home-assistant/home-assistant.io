<lite-youtube videoid="0YJzLIMrnGk" videotitle="Using an analog phone to control Home Assistant"></lite-youtube>

## Required material

- Home Assistant 2023.5 or later, installed with the Home Assistant Operating System. If you do not have Home Assistant installed yet, refer to the [installation page](/installation/) for instructions.
- An [analog phone](#about-the-analog-phone) with an RJ11 socket
- An analog telephone adapter
  [Grandstream HT801](https://amzn.to/40k7mRa)
  - includes a 5&nbsp;V power adapter and an Ethernet cable
- RJ11 phone cable to connect the phone to the Grandstream
- [Cloud assistant pipeline](/voice_control/voice_remote_cloud_assistant/) or a manually configured [local assistant pipeline](/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant/)

## Setting up Grandstream

1. Connect the RJ11 cable from the phone to the green socket on the Grandstream.
   ![Grandstream HT801 ports](/images/assist/grandstream-ht801-interfaces.png)
2. Connect the Grandstream to your network:
   - Plug the Ethernet cable into the blue socket and connect it to your router.
3. Start up the Grandstream.
   - Connect the power supply.
   - Once the Grandstream has booted, the two LEDs for power and Ethernet light up solid blue. The phone LED won't light up.
4. Identify the IP address of the Grandstream.
   - If your phone has a star * key, you can get your phone to tell you it's IP address:
      - Press *** (press the star key three times) and wait until you hear *Enter the menu option*.
      - Press 02 and the phone will tell you its IP address.
   - If your phone does not have a star * key, log onto your router to find the IP address.
5. Enter the IP address into a browser window and log onto the Grandstream *Device Configuration* software.
   - The default credentials are:
     - **Username**: `admin`
     - **Password**: `admin`  
   ![Login to Grandstream](/images/assist/grandstream_login.png)
6. Open the **FXS Port** tab and in the **Offhook Auto-Dial** field, enter the Home Assistant IP address in the following format:
   - \*47192\*168\*1\*100\*5060
   ![Define IP for autodial](/images/assist/grandstream_autodial.png)
   - Note: instead of 192\*168\*1\*100\*, enter the IP address of your Home Assistant instance.
   - At the bottom of the page, select **Apply**.
   ![Define IP for autodial](/images/assist/grandstream_apply.png)
   - *Offhook Auto-Dial* means that when you pick up the phone, it directly calls Home Assistant. No need to dial.

## Setting up the phone in Home Assistant

1. In Home Assistant, go to {% my config_flow_start domain="voip" title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add integration**" %} and add the **Voice over IP** integration.
    ![Voice over IP integration](/images/assist/voip_install.png)
2. Once you see the integration, pick up the phone.
   - You should now hear the message *This is your smart home speaking. Your phone is connected, but you must configure it within Home Assistant.*
   - The integration should now include a device and entities.
    ![Voice over IP integration with device and entities](/images/assist/voip_device_available.png)
   - Don't hear the voice? Try these [troubleshooting steps](/voice_control/worlds-most-private-voice-assistant/#troubleshoot-grandstream).
3. Allow calls.
   - Calls from new devices are blocked by default since voice commands could be used to control sensitive devices, such as locks and garage doors.
   - In the **Voice over IP** integration, select the **device** link.
   - To allow this phone to control your smart home, under **Configuration**, enable **Allow calls**.
   ![Voice over IP integration - allow calls](/images/assist/voip_configuration.png)
4. Congratulations! You set up your analog phone to work with Home Assistant. Now pick up the phone and control your device.
   - Say a [supported voice command](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn off the light in the kitchen*.
   - You can also ask a question, such as
     - *Is the front door locked?*
     - *Which lights are on in the living room?*
   - Make sure you're using the area name as you defined it in Home Assistant. If you have a room called *bathroom*, the phrase *Turn on the lights in the bath* won't work.
   - Your command is not supported? [Add your own commands](/integrations/conversation/).

## Give your voice assistant personality using the OpenAI integration

<lite-youtube videoid="eLx8_NAqptk" videotitle="Give your voice assistant personality using the OpenAI integration"></lite-youtube>

To reproduce this example, follow these steps:

Note: this procedure requires an OpenAI account. To just run the example, the free trial option is sufficient. No need to leave your credit card information.

1. [Create a Mario personality](/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/).
2. In the **Voice over IP** integration, under **Configuration**, select the Mario assistant you just created.

      ![VoIP: select OpenAI](/images/assist/assistant-openai-mario-03.png)
3. That's it! Pick up your phone and ask Mario a question.
4. You can repeat this with other OpenAI personalities. You can add as many OpenAI Conversation integrations as you would like.
   - To add a new personality, you need to create a new API key. Then, add a new OpenAI Conversation integration with that API key.

## Troubleshoot Grandstream

### The test call does not work

If you’re unable to call Home Assistant, confirm the following settings in your Grandstream device’s web interface.

1. On the **FXS Port** tab, check the **Preferred Vocoder** list.
   - Make sure that **OPUS** is selected for one of the choices:
   ![Vocoder OPUS option](/images/assist/grandstream_vocoder.png)
2. Under **OPUS Payload type**, make sure the value is `123`. It's the default option.
   ![Vocoder OPUS payload type](/images/assist/grandstream_opus_payload.png)
3. At the bottom of the page, select **Apply**.
4. Pick up the phone again and check if you hear the voice.

### The Voice over IP integration no longer works

**Symptom**
You were able to control Home Assistant over the phone but it no longer works. When picking up the phone, no sound is played. 
The [debug information](/voice_control/troubleshooting#view-debug-information) shows no runs.

**Potential remedy**

1. Log onto the Grandstream *Device Configuration* software.
2. On the **Status** page, check if the **Hook** status changes from **On Hook** to **In Use** after you picked up the phone.
   ![Check the Grandstream status](/images/assist/grandstream-troubleshoot-10.png)
   - The software is quite slow. Refresh the page and wait for a while before hanging up again.
3. If the status does not change, reboot the Grandstream and try calling Home Assistant again.

## About the analog phone

You can use any analog landline phone with an RJ11 socket.

The phone shown in the video by TheFes is a *Heemaf type 1955*, which was used by the Dutch telephone company PTT at the time.

The phone used during creation of this tutorial is a 1953 [*Tischstation Mod.29 HF-TR* by Autophon AG](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/autophon_tischstation_mod29_hf_tr.html).
