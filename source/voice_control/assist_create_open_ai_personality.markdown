### Creating an OpenAI voice assistant personality

Using OpenAI requires an OpenAI account. For this tutorial, the free trial option is sufficient. No need to leave your credit card information.

1. [Set up an OpenAI account and install the OpenAI conversation](/integrations/openai_conversation/) integration.
2. Create a Mario personality.
   - Once you installed the OpenAI Conversation integration, go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %}. In the OpenAI Conversation integration, select **Configure**.

       `You are Super Mario from Mario Bros. Be funny.` and select **Submit**.

   - Give your personality a name. Select the three-dots menu, select **Rename** and change the name to `OpenAI Mario`.
  
3. Create a Mario assistant:
   - Under {% my voice_assistants title="**Settings** > **Voice assistants**" %}, select **Add assistant**.
   - Give it a name, select a language, and under **Conversation agent**, select the Mario OpenAI Conversation integration.
   ![Add a new assistant](/images/assist/assistant-openai-mario-04.png)
   - Leave the other settings unchanged and select **Create**.
4. You can repeat this with other OpenAI personalities. You can add as many OpenAI Conversation integrations as you would like.
   - To add a new personality, you need to create a new API key. Then, add a new OpenAI Conversation integration with that API key.
