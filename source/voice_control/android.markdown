### Prerequisites

2. Under **Digital assistant app**, select **Default digital assistant app**.
   - On some Android versions, this might be under **Digital & voice input** > **Default digital assistant app** > **Voice Assistant**.

   - On some Android versions, you might be able to change the assistant's language settings here by selecting the cogwheel {% icon "mdi:cog-outline" %}.
4. Go back one step. The **Default digital assistant app** should now show *Home Assistant* as the default.
5. Leave the **Settings**.

   - On the Android phone, go to **Settings** > **Companion app** and select **Add server**.

3. Start Assist using the gesture to start an assistant. The gesture may differ depending on the version.
   - Swipe from the bottom left corner.
   - Long press the power button.
   - Hold the home button (square button at the bottom).
