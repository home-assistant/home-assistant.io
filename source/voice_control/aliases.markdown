title: "Assist - entity and area aliases"
---

Assist will use the names of your entities and areas, as well as any aliases you've configured. The configured aliases are not only used by Assist, but can also be used by Google Assistant, if you have set that up.

These aliases are helpful in case you call the same device by multiple names
or when using a voice assistant in multiple languages at the same time.

## Adding an alias of an entity

There are multliple ways to add an alias of an entity:

- **Option 1**: Go to **Settings** > **Voice assistants**. On the **Expose** tab, select the entity for which you want to add an alias.
