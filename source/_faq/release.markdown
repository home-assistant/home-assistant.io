New major versions of Home Assistant are released every three weeks on a Wednesday. The exact dates can be seen in the upcoming events calendar on the [Home Assistant Developers](https://developers.home-assistant.io/) website. 

This release schedule allows for two weeks of development time and one week of beta testing. Users who participate in the beta can view the changelog under [beta release notes](https://rc.home-assistant.io/latest-release-notes/) and get help in the `#beta` channel of [Home Assistant's Discord server](https://discord.gg/RMC8WkX).
