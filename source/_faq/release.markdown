New versions of Home Assistant are released on the first Wednesday of every month. The exact dates can be seen in the upcoming events calendar on the [Home Assistant Developers](https://developers.home-assistant.io/) website. 

A list of all releases in our history and their announcement blog posts
can be found [here](/blog/categories/core/).

The last week of our release schedule is primarily focused on beta testing. Users who participate in the beta can view the changelog under [beta release notes](https://rc.home-assistant.io/latest-release-notes/) and get help in the `#beta` channel of [Home Assistant's Discord server](/join-chat). Testers are also encouraged to [report issues on GitHub](/help/#bugs-feature-requests-and-alike).
