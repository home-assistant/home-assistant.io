When an integration does not show up, many different things can be the case. Before you try any of these steps, make sure to look at the `home-assistant.log` file and see if there are any errors related to your integration you are trying to set up.

If you have incorrect entries in your configuration files you can use the CLI script to check your configuration, each installation type has its own section in the common-tasks about this:

- [Operating System](/common-tasks/os/#configuration-check)
- [Container](/common-tasks/container/#configuration-check)
- [Core](/common-tasks/core/#configuration-check)
- [Supervised](/common-tasks/supervised/#configuration-check)
