Each dashboard is made up of cards.

## Card categories

There are several different card types, each with their own configuration options. They can be categorized in terms of their function:

- **Specific to a device type or service**: alarm, light, humidifier, thermostat, plant status, media control, weather forecast, shopping list, map, logbook, and calendar card
- **Grouping other cards**: vertical stack, horizontal stack, and grid card
- **Logic function**: conditional and entity filter card
- **Display generic data**: sensor, history graph, statistic, statistics graph, energy, gauge, and webpage card
- **Control devices and entities**: button and entity card
- **Display data and control entities**: area, picture elements, and picture glance card

## Card actions, features, header and footer widgets

Some cards have support for [tap actions](/dashboards/actions/). These actions define what will happen when you tap or hold on an object within a card.

Some cards have support for [features](/dashboards/features/). These widgets add quick controls to the card. Supported features depend on the card and entity capabilities. Multiple features can be added to a single card.

Some cards have support for [header and footer widgets](/dashboards/header-footer/). These widgets fill up the entire available space in a card.

## Adding cards to your dashboard

1. If this is your first time editing a dashboard, [take control of the default dashboard](/dashboards/#get-started-with-your-own-dashboard).

2. Choose one of the two methods to add cards to a dashboard:

{% details "Using the Add card button" %}

1. In the bottom right, select **Add card**.

2. There are two methods to add a card: **By card** type and **By entity**:
   - **By card** type:
        - If you have an idea of what card type you want to use for an entity, browse the list of available cards.
        - If you are using the **Sections** view, try the **Tile** card in the **Suggested cards** section.

   - **By entity**:
        - If you want to add multiple entities at once, select them from the list.
        - Then, select **Continue**.

Another way to add entities to a dashboard is to use the **Device** page.

1. Go to **{% my integrations title="Settings > Devices & services" %}**.
2. On the integration card of interest, select **Devices**. 
   - If there are multiple devices, select the device from the list.

3. In the **Controls** section, select **Add to Dashboard**.
