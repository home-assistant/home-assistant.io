## Adding cards to your dashboard

A card can be added to a dashboard directly [from the view](#to-add-a-card-from-a-view) where you want to add it, or from the [device page](#to-add-a-card-from-the-device-page).

### To add a card from a view

1. In the bottom right of the view, select **Add card**.

2. There are two methods to add a card:
   - If you have an idea of what card type you want to use for an entity, add **By card** type:
        - Browse the list of available cards.
        - If you are using the **Sections** view, try the **Tile** card in the **Suggested cards** section.
        ![Add card by Card type dialog](/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/sections-add-card-by-card.png)

   - If you want to add cards for multiple entities at once, select **By entity**.
        - Select the entities from the list.
        - Then, select **Continue**.
        ![Screenshot add cards by entity](/images/dashboards/dashboard_add-by-entity_02.png)

3. If you want this card to be visible only to specific users or under a certain condition, you can [define those conditions](#showing-or-hiding-a-card-conditionally).
4. If you are adding this card to a [sections view](/dashboards/sections/), on the **Layout** tab, you can [resize the card](#resizing-a-card).
5. If you like, define [card actions, features, header and footer widgets](#card-actions-features-header-and-footer-widgets).
   - Not all cards support these elements. Refer to the documentation of the specific card type.
6. Select **Add to dashboard**.

### To add a card from the device page

This method is useful if you are on the **Device** page and want to create a card directly from there.

1. Go to **{% my integrations title="Settings > Devices & services" %}**.
2. On the integration card of interest, select **Devices**.
   - If there are multiple devices, select the device from the list.
3. Add the card:
   - Find the area of interest, for example **Sensors**, or **Events** and select **Add to Dashboard**.
  ![Add to Dashboard button on the device page](/images/dashboards/add_card_from_device_page.png)
4. In the dialog, select the target dashboard and if you have multiple views, select the view.
   - Select **Next**.
   - If you like the card proposal, select **Add to dashboard**.
   - If you want to change the card, **Pick different card** and choose your card type.
   - **Result**: The card is added to the selected view.
  ![Add to Dashboard button on the device page](/images/dashboards/add_card_from_device_page_02.png)
5. To edit the card configuration, open the view to which you added the card.
   - Select **Edit card**.
6. If you want this card to be visible only to specific users or under a certain condition, you can [define those conditions](#showing-or-hiding-a-card-conditionally).
7. If you are adding this card to a [sections view](/dashboards/sections/), on the **Layout** tab, you can [resize the card](#resizing-a-card).

8. If you like, define [card actions, features, header and footer widgets](#card-actions-features-header-and-footer-widgets).
   - Not all cards support these elements. Refer to the documentation of the specific card type.

## Showing or hiding a card conditionally

You can choose to show or hide certain cards based on different conditions. The [available conditions](/dashboards/conditional/#card-conditions) are the same as the ones for the conditional card.

1. On the **Visibility** tab, select **Add condition**.
   - Don't see a **Visibility** tab?
     - It is not available inside nested cards: vertical stack, horizontal stack, and grid card
2. Select the type of condition, and enter the parameters.
   - If you define multiple conditions, the section is only shown when all conditions are met.
   - If you did not define any conditions, the section is always shown, to all users.
3. Select **Save**.

## Resizing a card

In [sections view](/dashboards/sections/), you can resize cards. Follow these steps:

1. On the **Layout** tab, move the sliders to adjust the card size.
    - Don't see a **Layout** tab?
      - It is not available inside nested cards: vertical stack, horizontal stack, and grid card
      - It is not available on the picture elements card.

2. Select **Save**.

## Revert resizing of a card

If you previously [resized](#resizing-a-card) a card in the [sections view](/dashboards/sections/), and you don't like the new size, you can revert back to the card's default size. Follow these steps:

1. On the **Layout** tab, select the {% icon "mdi:restore" %} icon.
   ![Screenshot of the Layout tab in the card dialog](/images/dashboards/card_resize.png)

2. Select **Save**.

## Card actions, features, header and footer widgets

Some cards have support for [tap actions](/dashboards/actions/). These actions define what will happen when you tap or hold on an object within a card.

Some cards have support for [features](/dashboards/features/). These widgets add quick controls to the card. Supported features depend on the card and entity capabilities. Multiple features can be added to a single card.

Some cards have support for [header and footer widgets](/dashboards/header-footer/). These widgets fill up the entire available space in a card.
