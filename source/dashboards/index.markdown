Home Assistant dashboards allow you to display information about your smart home. Dashboards are customizable and provide a powerful way to manage your home from your mobile or desktop.

You can customize your dashboard using various options:

- Different card types to visualize your data and control your smart home devices.
- [Themes](/integrations/frontend/#defining-themes) (even at a per card basis).
- Override names and icons of entities.
- Use custom cards from our amazing community.
