The Home Assistant frontend allows users to browse and control the state of their house, manage their automations and configure integrations.
The frontend is built with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

## Icons

Home Assistant utilizes the community-driven [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) project for icons in the frontend. The [Icons section](/docs/frontend/icons/) has more information on how to use icons and suggest new ones.

## Examples

The [User Interface section](/examples/#user-interface) can give you some starting points to expand the frontend.
