description: "List all available variables made available by triggers."

Automations support [templating](/docs/configuration/templating/) in the same way as scripts do. In addition to the [Home Assistant template extensions](/docs/configuration/templating/#home-assistant-template-extensions) available to scripts, the `trigger` and `this` template variables are available.

The template variable `this` is also available when evaluating any `trigger_variables` declared in the configuration.

## Available `this` data

The variable `this` is the [state object](/docs/configuration/state_object) of the automation at the moment of triggering the actions. State objects also contain context data which can be used to identify the user that caused a {% term script %} or {% term automation %} to execute. Note that `this` will not change while executing the {% term actions %}.

## Available trigger data

The variable `trigger` is an object that contains details about which {% term trigger %} triggered the automation.

Templates can use the data to modify the actions performed by the automation or displayed in a message. For example, you could create an automation that multiple sensors can trigger and then use the sensor's location to specify a light to activate; or you could send a notification containing the friendly name of the sensor that triggered it.

Each [trigger platform](/docs/automation/trigger/#event-trigger) can include additional data specific to that platform.

### All

Triggers from all platforms will include the following data.

| Template variable | Data |
| ---- | ---- |
| `trigger.id` | The [`id` of the trigger](/docs/automation/trigger/#trigger-id).
| `trigger.idx` | Index of the trigger. (The first trigger idx is `0`.)
