## Energy vs Power

Seldomly these two terms are used to refer to energy, but they are very different physical concepts. Energy is a quantitative measurement of what it takes to produce work (e.g. heat water) while Power measures the speed at which energy is transferred.

Electrical Power is usually measured in Watts (W) and Electrical Energy is usually measured in Watt-Hour (Wh) (not to be confused with Watt/Hour).

This difference is very important as you need to use the proper entities and/or convert between the two. Energy (Watt-Hour) is not an average of the Power you are consuming over a given period of time, but the sum of the power function: Power is the derivative of Energy over time.

Think of this in a parallel to speed and distance: Power is the speed you are going and Energy is the distance driven.
