The authentication system secures access to Home Assistant.

## Login screen

You are greeted with a log in screen, asking you for user name and password.

## User accounts

When you start Home Assistant for the first time, the _owner_ user account is created. This account has some special privileges and can:

- Create and manage other user accounts.
- Configure integrations and other settings (coming soon).

{% warning %}
For the moment, other user accounts will have the same access as the owner account. In the future, non-owner accounts will be able to have restrictions applied.
{% endwarning %}

{% note %}
If you want to manage users and you're an owner but you do not see "Users" in your main configuration menu, make sure that **Advanced Mode** is enabled for your user in your profile.
{% endnote %}

### Your account profile

Once you're logged in, you can see the details of your account on the {% my profile title="**User profile**" %} page by selecting on the circular at the very bottom of the sidebar.

You can:

- Change your password.
- Enable or disable [multi-factor authentication](/docs/authentication/multi-factor-auth/).
- Delete _Refresh Tokens_. These are created when you log in from a device. Delete them if you want to force the device to log out.
- Create [Long Lived Access Tokens](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token) so scripts can securely interact with Home Assistant.
- Define language and other locale settings.
- Log out of Home Assistant.

{% note %}
Unused refresh tokens will be automatically removed. A refresh token is considered unused if it has not been used for a login within 90 days. If you need a permanent token, then we recommend using [Long Lived Access Tokens](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token).
{% endnote %}

### Securing your login

_Make sure to choose a secure password!_ At some time in the future, you will probably want to access Home Assistant from outside your local network. This means you are also exposed to random black-hats trying to do the same. Treat the password like the key to your house.

As an extra level of security, you can turn on [multi-factor authentication](/docs/authentication/multi-factor-auth/).

## Adding a person to Home Assistant

If you have administrator rights, you can [add a person to Home Assistant](/integrations/person/#adding-a-person-to-home-assistant) and create them a user account.

## Changing display or user name

To learn how to change a display or user name, refer to [setting up basic information](/docs/configuration/basic/).

## Other authentication techniques

Home Assistant provides several ways to authenticate. See the [Auth providers](/docs/authentication/providers/) section.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication failures from `127.0.0.1`

If you're seeing authentication failures from `127.0.0.1` and you're using the `nmap` device tracker, you should [exclude the Home Assistant IP](/integrations/nmap_tracker#exclude) from being scanned.

### Bearer token warnings

Under the new authentication system you'll see the following warning logged when the [legacy API password](/docs/authentication/providers/#legacy-api-password) is supplied, but not configured in Home Assistant:

```txt
WARNING (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.http.auth] You need to use a bearer token to access /blah/blah from 192.0.2.4
```

If you see this, you need to add an [`api_password`](/integrations/http/#api_password) to your `http:` configuration.

### Bearer token informational messages

If you see the following, then this is a message for integration developers, to tell them they need to update how they authenticate to Home Assistant. As an end user you don't need to do anything:

```txt
INFO (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.http.auth] You need to use a bearer token to access /blah/blah from 192.0.2.4
```

### Lost owner password

If you lose the password associated with the owner account, you need to [start a new onboarding process](/docs/locked_out/#to-prepare-the-system-to-start-a-new-onboarding-process).

### Error: invalid client id or redirect URL

<img src='/images/docs/authentication/error-invalid-client-id.png' alt='Screenshot of Error: invalid client id or redirect url'>

You have to use a domain name, not IP address, to remote access Home Assistant otherwise you will get `Error: invalid client id or redirect url` error on the login form. However, you can use the IP address to access Home Assistant in your home network.

This is because we only allow an IP address as a client ID when your IP address is an internal network address (e.g., `192.168.0.1`) or loopback address (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).

If you don't have a valid domain name for your Home Assistant instance, you can modify the `hosts` file on your computer to fake one.
On Linux edit the `/etc/hosts` file, and add following entry:

```text
12.34.56.78 homeassistant.home
```

Replace `12.34.56.78` with your Home Assistant's public IP address.

This will allow you to open Home Assistant at `http://homeassistant.home:8123/`

### Stuck on loading data

Some ad blocking software, such as Wipr, also blocks WebSockets. If you're stuck on the Loading data screen, try disabling your ad blocker.
