Once you have more devices, you may want to target entire groups of devices in automations. It also becomes more challenging to find items in lists.

There are a few tools to group your assets: [Areas](#areas), [floors](#floors), [labels](#labels), and [categories](#categories).

| Taxonomy | Automation target | Entity can have multiple |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Area     | ✅                 | ❌                        |
| Floor    | ✅                 | ❌                        |
| Label    | ✅                 | ✅                        |
| Category | ❌                 | ❌                        |

## Area

- Groups {% term devices %} and {% term entities %}.
- Can be assigned to one floor.
- Reflects a physical area (or room) in your home.
- Can be used in automations: Allows targeting an entire group of devices with a service call. For example, turning off all the lights in the living room.

- Areas can also be used to automatically generate cards, such as the [Area card](/dashboards/area/).

## Floor

- Groups areas.
- {% term Devices %} and {% term entities %} cannot be assigned to floors, but to areas only.
- Can have multiple areas.
- Can be used in automations and scripts as a target for actions. For example, to turn off all the lights on the downstairs floor when you go to bed.

## Labels

- Can be assigned to areas, devices, entities, automations, scenes, scripts, and helpers.
- Can be used in automations and scripts as a target for actions and services.
- Labels can also be used to filter data in tables. For example, you can filter the list of devices to show only devices with the label `heavy energy usage` or turn these devices off when there is not a lot of solar energy available.

## Category

- Groups items in a table.
- Categories are unique for each table. The automations page can have different categories than the scene, scripts, or helpers settings page.
