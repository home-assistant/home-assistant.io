## The blueprint schema

The configuration schema of a blueprint consists of 2 parts:

1. The blueprint's high-level metadata: name, description, the input required from the user.
2. The schema of the thing the blueprint describes.

The first part is referred to as the *blueprint schema*. It contains the
blueprint's metadata.

The only requirement for a blueprint is a name. In its most basic form,
a blueprint would look like:

```yaml
blueprint:
  name: Example blueprint
  domain: automation
```

Although this is a valid blueprint, it is not very useful.

The second part depends on the use case of the blueprint. For example, if you create a blueprint for an automation, the full
schema for an [automation](/docs/automation/yaml/) applies.

You can add a description of the blueprint's use case and user inputs.

This is the full blueprint schema:

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: The name of the blueprint. Keep this short and descriptive.
  type: string
  required: true
description:
  description: >
    The description of the blueprint. While optional, this field is highly
    recommended. Describe what the blueprint does and describe the inputs the blueprint provide. The description can
    include [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
  type: string
  required: false
domain:
  description: >
    The domain in which this blueprint is used. Currently, only
    [`automation`](/docs/automation/yaml/) and `script` are supported.
  type: string
  required: true
author:
  description: The name of the blueprint author.
  type: string
  required: false
homeassistant:
  description: >
    Home Assistant requirements to be able to use the blueprint successfully.
  type: map
  required: false
  keys:
    min_version:
      description: >
        Minimum required version of Home Assistant to use the blueprint. For example,
        `2022.4.0`. It is important to set this if the blueprint uses any features
        introduced in recent releases to head off issues.
      type: string
      required: false
input:
  description: >
    A dictionary of defined user inputs or sections. These are the input fields that the
    consumer of your blueprint can provide using YAML definition, or via
    a configuration form in the UI. Sections provide a way to visually group a set of 
    related inputs (see below).
  type: map
  required: false
{% endconfiguration %}

### Blueprint inputs

As described above, a blueprint can accept one (or multiple)
inputs from the blueprint user.

These inputs can be of any type (string, boolean, list, dictionary). They can have
a default value and also provide a [selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/) that
ensures a matching input field in the user interface.

A blueprint input has the following configuration:

{% configuration %}
  name:
    description: The name of the input field.
    type: string
    required: false
  description:
    description: >
      A short description of the input field. Keep this short and descriptive.
      The description can include [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
    type: string
    required: false
  selector:
    description: >
      The [selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/) to use for this input. A
      selector defines how the input is displayed in the frontend UI.
    type: selector
    required: false
  default:
    description: >
      The default value of this input, in case the input is not provided
      by the user of this blueprint.
    type: any
    required: false

{% endconfiguration %}

Each input field can be referred to, outside of the blueprint metadata, using
the `!input` custom YAML tag.

The following example shows a minimal blueprint with a single input:

```yaml
blueprint:
  name: Example blueprint
  description: Example showing an input
  input:
    my_input:
      name: Example input
```

In the above example, `my_input` is the identifier of the input. It can be
referenced by using the `!input my_input` custom tag.

In this example, no [`selector`](/docs/blueprint/selectors/) was provided. In the user interface, a text input field would be shown to the user.
It is then up to the user to find out what to enter there. Blueprints that come with [selectors](/docs/blueprint/selectors/) are easier to use.

A blueprint can have as many inputs as you like.

### Blueprint input sections

One or more input sections can be added under the main `input` key. Each section visually groups the inputs in that section, 
allows an optional description, and optionally allows for collapsing those inputs. 

A section is differentiated from an input by the presence of an additional `input` key within that section. 

{% caution %}
Input sections are a new feature in version 2024.6. Set the `min_version` for the blueprint to at least this version if using input sections. Otherwise, the blueprint will generate errors on older versions. 
{% endcaution %}

The full configuration for a section is below:

{% configuration %}

name:
  description: A name for the section. If omitted the key of the section is used.
  type: string
  required: false
icon:
  description: An icon to display next to the name of the section.
  type: string
  required: false
description:
  description: >
    An optional description of this section, which will be displayed at the top of the section.
    The description can include [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).
  type: string
  required: false
collapsed:
  description: If `true`, the section will be collapsed by default. Useful for optional or less important inputs. All collapsed inputs must also have a defined `default` before they can be hidden.
  type: boolean
  default: false
  required: false
input:
  description: >
    A dictionary of defined user inputs within this section.
  type: map
  required: true

{% endconfiguration %}



The following example shows a blueprint with some inputs in a section:

```yaml
blueprint:
  name: Example sections blueprint
  description: Example showing a section
  input:
    base_input:
      name: An input not in the section
    my_section:
      name: My Section
      icon: mdi:cog
      description: These options control a specific feature of this blueprint
      input:
        my_input:
          name: Example input
        my_input_2:
          name: 2nd example input
```

### Blueprint inputs in templates

The inputs are available as custom YAML tags, but not as template variables.
To use a blueprint input in a template, it first needs to be exposed as either
a [script level variable](/integrations/script/#configuration-variables) or in
a [variable script step](/docs/scripts/#variables).

```yaml
variables:
  # Make input my_input available as a script level variable
  my_input: !input my_input
```

### Example blueprints

The [built-in blueprints][blueprint-built-in]
are great examples to get a bit of a feeling of how blueprints work.

Here is the built-in motion light automation blueprint:

```yaml
blueprint:
  name: Motion-activated Light
  description: Turn on a light when motion is detected.
  domain: automation
  input:
    motion_entity:
      name: Motion Sensor
      selector:
        entity:
          filter:
            device_class: motion
            domain: binary_sensor
    light_target:
      name: Light
      selector:
        target:
          entity:
            domain: light
    no_motion_wait:
      name: Wait time
      description: Time to leave the light on after last motion is detected.
      default: 120
      selector:
        number:
          min: 0
          max: 3600
          unit_of_measurement: seconds

# If motion is detected within the delay,
# we restart the script.
mode: restart
max_exceeded: silent

trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: !input motion_entity
    from: "off"
    to: "on"

action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target: !input light_target
  - wait_for_trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: !input motion_entity
      from: "on"
      to: "off"
  - delay: !input no_motion_wait
  - service: light.turn_off
    target: !input light_target
```
