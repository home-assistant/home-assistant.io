One major advantage of Home Assistant is that it is not dependent on cloud services. Even if you are only using Home Assistant on a local network, you should take steps to secure your instance.

## Checklist

Here's the summary of what you *must* do to secure your Home Assistant system:

- Centralize sensitive data in [secrets](/docs/configuration/secrets/) (but do remember to back them up)
  - **Note**: Storing secrets in `secrets.yaml` does not encrypt them.
- Regularly keep the system up to date

## Remote access

If you want secure remote access, the easiest option is to use [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) by which you also [support](https://www.nabucasa.com/about/) the founders of Home Assistant.

Another option is to use TLS/SSL via the add-on [Duck DNS](/integrations/duckdns/) integrating Let's Encrypt.

To expose your instance to the internet, use a [VPN](https://pivpn.io), or an [SSH tunnel](/blog/2017/11/02/secure-shell-tunnel/). Make sure to expose the used port in your router.

### Extras for manual installations

Besides the above we advise that you consider the following to improve security:

- For systems that use SSH set `PermitRootLogin no` in your sshd configuration (usually `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) and to use SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords. This is particularly important if you enable remote access to your SSH services.
- Lock down the host following good practice guidance, for example:
  - [Securing Debian Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/index.en.html) (this also applies to Raspberry Pi OS)
  - [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/security_guide/index), [CIS Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/)
