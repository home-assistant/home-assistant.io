As part of the default onboarding process, Home Assistant can detect your location from IP address geolocation. Home Assistant will automatically select a unit system and time zone based on this location. If you didn't adjust this directly during onboarding, you can do it later.

The general settings described here are managed by the [Home Assistant Core integration](/integrations/homeassistant/). If you are interested in the services offered by this integration, check out the integration documentation.

## Editing the general settings

To change the general settings that were defined during onboarding, follow these steps:

1. Go to {% my general title="**Settings** > **System** > **General**" %} and make your changes.
2. To change network-related configuration, such as the network name, go to {% my network title="**Settings** > **System** > **Network**" %}.
3. If some of the settings are not visible, you may need to enable **Advanced mode**.
   - In the bottom left, select your user name to go to your {% my profile title="**User profile**" %}, and enable **Advanced mode**.
4. **Troubleshooting**: If any of the settings are grayed out and can't be edited, this is because they are defined in the {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
   - If you prefer editing the settings in the UI, you have to delete these entries from the {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %} file.
   - For more information about the general settings in YAML, refer to the [Home Assistant Core integration documentation](/integrations/homeassistant/).

5. To apply the changes, follow the steps on [reloading the configuration](/docs/configuration/#reloading-configuration-changes).
