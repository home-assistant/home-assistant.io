Labels in Home Assistant allow grouping elements irrespective of their physical location or type. Labels can be assigned to areas, devices, entities, automations, scenes, scripts, and helpers. Labels can be used in automations and scripts as a target for actions and services. Labels can also be used to filter data.

For example, you can filter the list of devices to show only devices with the label `heavy energy usage` or turn these devices off when there is not a lot of solar energy available.
