Categories let you group and filter items in a table. Like labels, categories allow grouping irrespective of the items physical location.

For example, on the automations page, you can create the categories “Notifications” or “NFC tags” to view your automations grouped or filtered. These categories group automations on the automation page, but have no effect anywhere else. Categories are unique for each table. The automations page can have different categories than the scene, scripts, or helpers settings page.

## Creating a category

Follow these steps to create a new category.

1. Go to {% my automations title="**Settings** > **Automations & Scenes**" %} and open the respective tab.
2. In the top left,  select the **Filters** button.

   **Result**: A new category is created.

## Assigning a category

1. Go to {% my automations title="**Settings** > **Automations & Scenes**" %} and open the respective tab.
2. To assign a category to a single item:
   - Find the item in the list and select the three dots {% icon "mdi:dots-vertical" %} menu.
   - Select **Assign category** and select the category from the list.
   - If the category is not in the list, select **Add new category** and make a new one.
3. To assign a category to multiple items:
   - Select the <img height="28px" src="/images/organizing/multiselect_icon.png" alt="Multiselect icon"/> button.
   - From the list, select all the items to which you want to apply a category.
   - In the top right corner, select **Move to category**.
   - Then, select the category from the list.
4. Once categories are applied, the table items are grouped by those categories.
   - The example shows 2 categories: Coffee and housekeeping.
