When working with tables, you can select multiple elements to apply an action on multiple items at once. If you have [grouped](/docs/organizing/) your assets by assigning them to floors, areas, labels, or directories you can also filter your data accordingly.

## Selecting multiple items in a table

1. In your table, select the <img height="28px" src="/images/organizing/multiselect_icon.png" alt="Multiselect icon"/> button.
