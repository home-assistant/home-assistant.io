When working with tables, you can select multiple elements to apply an action on multiple items at once. If you have [grouped](/docs/organizing/) your assets by assigning them to floors, areas, labels, or directories you can also filter your data accordingly.

## Selecting multiple items in a table

1. In your table, select the <img height="28px" src="/images/organizing/multiselect_icon.png" alt="Multiselect icon"/> button.

You can filter a table so that only items matching certain criteria are shown.

1. In the top left corner above the table, select the **Filters** button.

2. In the filters panel, select your filter criteria.
   - You can filter for [floors](/docs/organizing/floors/), [areas](/docs/organizing/areas/), [labels](/docs/organizing/labels/) and [categories](/docs/organizing/categories/) if you have previously defined them.

## Grouping and sorting items in a table

You can group items in a table according to certain criteria. The number of shown items stays the same. No items will be hidden.

1. In the top right above the table, select the **Group by** button.
2. The items will be grouped according to the criteria you chose.
   - In the example, the items are grouped by manufacturer.
