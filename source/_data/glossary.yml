- term: Action
  definition: |-
    Actions are used in several places in Home Assistant. As part of a script or
    automation, actions define what is going to happen once a trigger is
    activated. In scripts, an action is called *sequence*. An action is a **software
    function that interacts with targets to make something happen**. Actions can use other actions
    and/or scenes to interact with entities and cause these entities to do
    something. Actions can also include conditions and a delay. An action can
    perform multiple actions at the same time. For example, if your presence is
    detected in a room, an action may perform one action to turn on a light and
    perform another action to start playing music after a delay. Actions are also
    used on the dashboard, for example as tap or hold action on a UI element.
    When triggered, the action performs another action. Home Assistant provides a series of predefined actions,
    such as `homeassistant.turn_on`, `homeassistant.toggle`, or
    `homeassistant.reload`.

- term: Add-on
  definition: >-
    Add-ons are additional standalone third-party software packages that can be
    installed on Home Assistant OS. Most of these, add-on provided, applications
    can be integrated into Home Assistant using integrations. Examples of
    add-ons are: an MQTT broker, database service or a file server.

- term: Area
  definition: >-
    An area in Home Assistant is a logical grouping of devices and entities that
    are meant to match areas (or rooms) in the physical world: your home. For
    example, the `living room` area groups devices and entities in your living
    room. Areas allow you to target actions at an entire group of devices.
    For example, turning off all the lights in the living room. Locations within
    your home such as living room, dance floor, etc. Areas can be assigned to
    floors. Areas can also be used for automatically generated cards, such as
    the [Area card](/dashboards/area/).

- term: Automation
  definition: >-
    Automations connect one or more triggers to one or more actions in a 'when
    trigger then do action' fashion with additional optional conditions. For
    example, an automation might connect the trigger 'sunset' to the action
    'turn the lights on' but only if the condition 'someone is home' is met.
    Pre-made automations for common use-cases are available via [the blueprints
    feature](/docs/automation/using_blueprints/).

- term: Category
  definition: >-
    A category is an organization tool that allows grouping items in a table.
    Like labels, categories allow grouping irrespective of the items' physical
    location. For example, on the automations page, you can create the
    categories “Notifications” or “NFC tags” to view your automations grouped or
    filtered. Categories are unique for each table. The automations page can
    have different categories than the scene, scripts, or helpers settings page.
  aliases:
    - categories
- term: Commissioning
  definition: >-
    In the context of Matter devices, *commissioning* is the process of adding a
    device to a Matter controller. It is the equivalent of pairing a device in
    Zigbee or Z-Wave. Commissioning is done by scanning a QR code or entering a
    code manually. The code is printed on the device or its packaging. The code
    contains information about the device, such as its type, manufacturer, and
    serial number. The controller uses this information to identify the device
    and to download the required information to control the device. For example,
    the controller downloads the device's capabilities, such as the supported
    commands and the available attributes. The controller also downloads the
    device's configuration, such as the device's name and location.

- term: Custom integration
  definition: >-
    A custom integration is an integration that has been created by someone from the Home Assistant community and has been published for others to use at their own risk. Custom integrations are not supported by the Home Assistant project. They are not reviewed or tested by the Home Assistant development team and thus may negatively impact the stability of your Home Assistant instance. An example of a custom integration is the [Spook](https://spook.boo/) integration.
- term: Customize
  definition: >-
    Customization allows you to overwrite the default parameters of your devices
    in the configuration.
- term: Device
  definition: |-
    A device is a model representing a physical or logical unit that contains
    entities. **Example for a device as a physical unit** A smart plug named
    'Coffee machine' which provides 2 entities: a `switch` entity to turn power
    on or off ('Coffee machine power switch') and a `sensor` entity for power
    monitoring ('Coffee machine power sensor'). **Example for a device as a
    logical unit** An ecobee thermostat with 4 room sensors. This thermostat is
    seen as 5 devices in Home Assistant: 1 device for the thermostat with 4
    sensors, and 1 device for each room sensor. Each device can be in a
    different area and may have more than one input or output within that area.
    Devices have properties such as ID, manufacturer, name, model, hardware
    version, firmware version, connections, etc.

- term: Discovery
  definition: >
    Discovery is the automatic setup of zeroconf/mDNS and uPnP devices after
    they are discovered.
- term: Domain
  definition: >-
    Each integration in Home Assistant has a unique identifier: a domain. All of
    the entities and actions available in Home Assistant are provided by
    integrations and thus belong to such a domain. The first part of the entity
    or action, before the `.` shows the domain they belong to. For example
    `light.kitchen` is an entity in the `light` domain from the [light
    integration](/integrations/light), while `hue.activate_scene` is the
    `activate_scene` action for the `hue` domain which belongs to the [Hue
    integration](/integrations/hue).
  excerpt: >
    Each integration in Home Assistant has a unique identifier: The domain. It
    is often shown as the first part (before the dot) of entity IDs.
  aliases:
    - domains
- term: Entity
  definition: |-
    An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant.
    Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other
    entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service. Entities have
    states. **Example for entities as part of a device** A combined temperature
    and humidity sensor device provides two sensor entities. One for temperature
    (e.g. `sensor.temperature` with state `21.0` and unit `°C`) and one for
    humidity (e.g. `sensor.humidity` with state `65.4` and unit `%`). **Example
    for entities as part of a service** A weather service that provides 3
    entities: wind speed, air pressure, and ozon level. **Example of an entity
    used for control** A fan that is turned on when the temperature exceeds
    30&nbsp;°C. There are standardized types of entities for common integrations
    such as light, switch, camera, sensor, fan, or vacuum. Some entities are not
    part of a device or service. Examples of standalone entities are automation,
    script, scene entities, and helper entities (e.g. input helpers). Most
    properties of entities are related to the state. Entities have optional
    attributes such as friendly name, unit of measurement, and an icon or
    picture that can be displayed in the frontend.

- term: Floor
  definition: >-
    A floor in Home Assistant is a logical grouping of areas that are meant to
    match the physical floors in your home. Devices & entities are not assigned
    to floors but to areas. A floor has properties such as: Floor ID, name,
    aliases (for use in assistants), an icon, and a floor level. Some of these
    properties are optional. The level number can be negative to reflect floors
    below the basement. Floors can be used in automations and scripts as a
    target for actions. For example, to turn off all the lights on the
    downstairs floor when you go to bed.

- term: Host
  definition: >-
    A device that can communicate with other devices on a network. During setup
    and configuration, an input requesting a **Host** typically refers to a
    device's network address so that Home Assistant can attempt to connect to
    it. This may be in the form of a hostname, URL, IP address or some other
    type of network identifier. If you do not know the hostname or IP address of
    a device, you can find it in your router's webinterface. For example, if
    your device is connected wirelessly, somewhere there is a page listing all
    the devices that are connected to your network. It depends on your router,
    where exactly this page is. It could be under **Network** > **Wireless**.
  excerpt: >-
    A device that participates in your network. If asked for the host, enter
    either the device's IP address or host name. If you don't know those, check
    the list of hosts in your router.

- term: Integration
  definition: >-
    Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with devices, services,
    and more. They contain all the logic to handle vendor- and device-specific
    implementations, such as authentication or specific protocols. The
    integration brings such device-specific elements into Home Assistant in a
    standardized way. For example, the [Hue](/integrations/hue) integration
    integrates the Philips Hue bridge and its connected bulbs into Home
    Assistant, making them available as Home Assistant light entities you can
    control.

  definition: >-
    Labels in Home Assistant allow grouping elements irrespective of their
    physical location or type. Labels can be assigned to areas, devices,
    entities, automations, scenes, scripts, and helpers. Labels can be used in
    automations and scripts as a target for actions. Labels can
    also be used to filter data. For example, you can filter the list of devices
    to show only devices with the label `heavy energy usage` or turn these
    devices off when there is not a lot of solar energy available.

- term: Matter
  definition: >-
    Matter is an open-source standard that defines how to control smart home
    devices on a Wi-Fi or Thread network. The aim of the standard is to improve
    security and to make devices interoperable across vendors, replacing
    proprietary protocols for smart home ecosystems. Unlike other standards,
    Matter allows joining the same device to multiple controllers. For example,
    you can add a light to Google Home, Apple Home, and Home Assistant at the
    same time. A bridge device can be used to connect devices running on other
    smart home technologies such as Zigbee or Z-Wave.

- term: Service
  definition: |-
    The term "service" in Home Assistant is used in the sense of an **information
    service**. For example, the municipal waste management service that provides
    entities for organic, paper, and packaging waste. In terms of functionality,
    the information service is like a device. It is called *service* to avoid
    confusion, as it does not come with a piece of hardware.
  link: /docs/scripts/perform-actions/
  aliases:
    - services
- term: State
  definition: |-
    The state holds the information of interest of an entity. For example, if a
    light is on or off, the current temperature, or the amount of energy used.
    The data type of state is `string` (a textual value). Entities store 2
    timestamps related to the state: `last_updated` and `last_changed`. Each
    entity has exactly one state and the state only holds one value at a time.
    However, entities can store attributes related to that state. For example,
    the state of a light is _on_, and the related state attributes could be its
    current brightness and color values. State changes can be used as the source
    of triggers. The current state can be used in conditions.

- term: Thread
  definition: >-
    Thread is a low-power mesh networking standard that is specifically designed
    for smart home applications. It is a protocol that defines how devices
    communicate. *Mesh* topology means that the devices can communicate with
    each other directly, without going through a central controller first.
    Thread uses the same radio frequency (RF) technology as Zigbee, but provides
    IP connectivity similar to Wi-Fi. Unlike Zigbee, Thread does not specify how
    to control devices. How Thread-enabled devices are controlled is specified
    in a higher level protocol such as HomeKit or Matter.

- term: Thread border router
  definition: >-
    A Thread border router forwards data packets between your local network and
    the Thread network. This enables smart home devices within a Thread network
    to communicate with IPv6-capable devices in your local network. A Thread
    border router is connected to your network either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet and
    uses its radio frequency (RF) radio to communicate with the Thread mesh
    network. In case of Matter, the data that is forwarded is encrypted.
    Examples of Thread border routers are the Nest Hub (2nd gen), the HomePod
    mini, and the Home Assistant Connect&nbsp;ZBT-1 together with the OpenThread Border
    Router add-on.
