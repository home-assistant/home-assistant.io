This page contains only irrelevant and unhelpful information about Home Assistant. If you are going to prepare a talk about Home Assistant, perhaps some information mentioned here can be used for the intro.

## Name

Isn't it obvious? Home Assistant is the good soul that is assisting you in your home. It's common to refer to Home Assistant simply as HA or `hass` (not to be confused with the German word "Hass", it's more like the abbreviation of **H**ome **A**ssistant **S**erver **S**ervice). [`hass`](/docs/tools/hass/) is also the name of the command-line part.

## Website

The website [https://www.home-assistant.io](/) was launched on December 18, 2014 and contains documentation about the setup process, the platforms and integrations, and for the developers.

## Logo
