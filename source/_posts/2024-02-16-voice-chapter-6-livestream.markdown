Even though our Year of the Voice has ended, that does not mean the development of our voice assistant has stopped! We're excited to show you what we've been working on since [Chapter 5](https://www.youtube.com/live/djEkgoS5dDQ) last year during our Chapter 6 livestream on Wednesday, February 21st, at 21:00 CET / 3:00 PM ET / 12:00 PM PT.

Want to get a sneak peek of what you can expect from this chapter? Well, remember the hype around chapter 4? Get ready for more of that!
