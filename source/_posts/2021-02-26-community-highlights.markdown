## Apexcharts Card

Would you like to map data in graphs? Then you should definitely try the new
[ApexCharts card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) from [RomRider](https://github.com/RomRider), 
the graphs in this card are based on the ApexChartsJS and that looks pretty cool.

## Home Assistant switch panel

Last week, [amauryverschooren](https://github.com/amauryverschooren) shared his
own version of a HA Switch Plate, so that you can operate your Home Assistant via
a physically small touch panel, which you can place in a specific room, for example.

## Lovelace dashboard inspiration

Still looking for some new inspiration for your Lovelace dashboards? Last week we
came across some beautiful Lovelace dashboards on our [Home Assistant subreddit][reddit]
page of [swake88](https://www.reddit.com/user/swake88/). Who knows, there might be something fun for you to make.

You can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/lqo7wr/ha_2_years_later_and_what_ive_built_so_far/) the related Reddit topic.

## Hidden garage

Do you have a vacuum cleaning robot but you don't know where to place the charging
station? Maybe you can hide these behind a plinth, like what [ialex87](https://www.reddit.com/user/ialex87/) did.
