The 27th edition of the Home Assistant Community Highlights! Some interesting
things popped up around our community, which we thought was worth sharing.

But first I have one more announcement. My internship is (almost) over and I'm
happy to say that I passed and completed it with a good grade. That also means that
this community highlight is the last one from me as an intern, time will tell
when the next one will appear.

Do you want to share something for the next edition?

## Blueprint of the week
------

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://gist.github.com/bfranke1973/4a0835efffc81759d02f44842265ea96" %}

This week's blueprint is that of [bfranke1973](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/bfranke1973),
who has created a blueprint with which you can receive a notification when
a device loses connection with the network. Try it out! Read more about it
on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or install this automation in your
instance with a click on the My button!

## Love Lock Card

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/CyrisXD/love-lock-card" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-06-25-community-highlights/lock.gif'
            alt="Preview of the love lock card"

        />
    </a>
</div>

Do you ever accidentally turn on a light or switch? Then try the
[love lock card](https://github.com/CyrisXD/love-lock-card) made by
[CyrisXD](https://github.com/CyrisXD). With this, you can create a card
that is locked and you can unlock it with, for example, a pin code or a
simple click on the card.

## Lovelace Dashboard
------

This week again we have a new Lovelace dashboard for the necessary portion
of inspiration ðŸ˜„ This time the one from [swake88](https://www.reddit.com/user/swake88/)
who is improving his [dashboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/o2za2z/slowly_redesigning_my_ha_dashboards_for_mobile/)
for use on a mobile device. If you want to know more about it, check out
the comment part on Reddit.

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center; margin-bottom:15px">
    <iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/homeassistant/comments/o2za2z/slowly_redesigning_my_ha_dashboards_for_mobile/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="639" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

Would you also like your dashboard to be in the community highlight? Drop it
on [Reddit][reddit] and maybe I'll pick it out for the next edition.

## Statistic Tools
------

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center; margin-bottom:15px">
    <iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/homeassistant/comments/o6co3v/mini_graph_card_that_displays_a_dynamic_color/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="426" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div>

Home Assistant has a number of tools for working with statistics, but the
question is how can you best approach this. [Carlos](https://www.reddit.com/user/cgomesu/)
has written a very good [guide](https://cgomesu.com/blog/smarter-hass/) on
how to get started and how to make cards that use this data.
