We recently held our [State of the Open Home 2024 live stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/oa__fLArsFk?si=PzlfiHLUYE6uAEq3), where we revealed how we are thinking [even bigger](/blog/2018/09/17/thinking-big/) about securing the future of the smart home. During this stream we launched the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), a new non-profit organization created to fight for the fundamental principles of the smart home — privacy, choice, and sustainability — focused on serving everyone that lives in one. To learn more about the Open Home Foundation read the full [announcement](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-open-home-foundation/).

The stream includes a deep dive into the evolution of Home Assistant and how it has now reached an estimated 1 million installations. There were other substantial updates on voice and hardware, including teasing our upcoming Z-Wave and voice assistant hardware. The first panel discussion featured the founders of Open Home Foundation collaborating projects WLED, Zigbee2MQTT, Rhasspy, and Z-Wave JS. A second panel gave a comprehensive overview of the state of open standards, featuring key open-source developers working on Zigbee, Z-Wave, Matter, and Bluetooth. The stream caps off with a look into the future of the open home, including the announcement of a roadmap full of exciting new features.
