Home Assistant Core 2022.7! ‚òÄÔ∏è

This was one exciting and busy month! In case you've missed it, there was
a [Matter in Home Assistant workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fOHBl5w0_k)
and a [Let's get loud!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEH-DxOsywg) event
about bringing audio to the [Open Home](https://building.open-home.io/).
If you have missed those, it is worthwhile to check those recordings out.

Meanwhile, preparations are happening for the upcoming Matter and of course,
the soon-to-be-released [Home Assistant Yellow]! üíõ More about that soon‚Ñ¢.

This release is definitely representing the "streamlining experiences"
motto we have been using. The performance improvements in this release are
once more: stunning! Furthermore, there are some wonderful new features to
explore too.

This release has the perfect mix! I'm sure there is something in here you
like. So without further due: Enjoy the release!

## Improved stability and performance, and Python 3.10

The quest to improve the performance of Home Assistant continues. For many
releases, [@bdraco] has been analyzing every single aspect of
Home Assistant and manages to make it faster every single release.

Usually, we have a section at the end of our release notes informing you
about the performance improvements made. The improvements in this release,
however, are a big deal.

Our YAML & JSON tooling improved, using faster libraries and methods.
JSON is used internally and for communication with the frontend, which is
A LOT snappier now. If you use lots of YAML, you will undoubtedly notice this
when starting Home Assistant or reloading things like your automations üöÄ.

Devices with an integration error during startup that can self-recover
will now do that instantly as soon as the device is discovered.

We now use a better and faster encryption method for the HomeKit Accessory
Protocol (HAP). It improves the performance of the HomeKit, HomeKit Controller,
and Apple TV integrations and prepares Home Assistant for iOS 16.

Lastly, [@pvizeli] has been working hard to ship Home Assistant on Python 3.10!
Which also brings quite a performance improvement. If you run the Home Assistant
Operating System or use our container installation method, you will
automatically get this; there is no need to do anything. üöÄ

## Update Z-Wave devices directly from Home Assistant

All software has bugs, including the software on your Z-Wave devices. But how
to update those? Have no fear! As of today, we have a solution for this!

Thanks to the hard work and collaboration between [@AlCalzone] from Z-Wave JS
and [@raman325] from Home Assistant, you can now install updates on your
Z-Wave devices directly from the Home Assistant interface!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/zwave-updating-firmware.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new upload firmware item on the device page of a Z-Wave device page'>

On the device page of your Z-Wave device, there is now a menu item allowing
you to install Z-Wave firmware updates onto your device manually.

Get a software update for your Z-Wave device from the manufacturer,
and start an update in Home Assistant, which allows you to upload the
update file you got from the manufacturer. The rest is pure magic!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/zwave-installing-firmware-update.png' alt='Screenshot showing the a Z-Wave device that has firmware installation in progress'>

During update installation, you'll be presented with the update's progress.

It is that easy üí™

[@raman325]: https://github.com/raman325

## The about page is now beautiful too!

Have you ever looked at the about page in the Home Assistant settings menu?

It was probably one of the least visually appealing pages still in our menus,
and [@zsarnett] seemed to agree. He made it a lot more cleaner and functional.

It now clearly shows the versions of the different components your instance is
made up of, and provides a clean menu to all kinds of Home Assistant related
links.

## Change any weather unit to your preference

Home Assistant has many [weather services] that can be integrated; it is
great to have a choice! The differences between those are often their
accuracy for your region and the  units of measurement used for the
different weather data points.

But what if you'd like the barometric pressure unit to be in mbar instead of
hPa? Or maybe use m/s or knots instead of km/h for wind speed? No problem!

You can now change the units each weather entity uses! Not just temperature,
but for all of the values a weather entity provides. When changing a unit,
Home Assistant will take care of converting the values for you.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/weather-units.png' alt='Screenshot showing energy usage being compared from last week with the week before that'>

On a similar note, number entities that represent a temperature are now converted to
the temperature unit used by the configured unit system.

Thanks [@emontnemery] and [@gjohansson-ST] for adding this and updating
all existing weather integrations to support this üëç.

## Labels instead of values for gauge cards segments

When displaying an entity gauge card on your dashboard, it would show the
gauge with the sensor value. For example, if you'd use a humidity sensor,
it shows the humidity percentage in the middle of the gauge.

In the [2022.5 release], we added segment support to our gauge card.
In this release, [@kristjanbjarni] added label support to those segments!

This means that if your segment has a label, the gauge card will show
that label instead of the sensor value when it is in that range.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/gauge-labels.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new gauge labels'>

For more information, check out our [gauge card documentation].

## Code editors now auto-complete MDI icons

All of our code editors in the frontend now have auto-completions for
MDI icons. Just start typing `mdi:` and it will help you find the exact icon
you need.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/icon-auto-complete.png' alt='Screenshot demonstrating auto-complete for MDI icons in the code editors'>

Like the normal icon picker, it supports searching on parts of the icon
name, its aliases and categories. Additionally, it will show a little preview
of the icon you are about to select, so you know you got the right one.

Thank you [@bramkragten], this is a really nice addition!

## Filter the history panel

If you have lots of devices and entities then the
{% my history title="history panel" %} can be long! Actually,
it would become so large, that it becomes unpractical. You could always
filter it down to a single entity, but that is fairly limited as well.
For this release, [@D3v01dZA] improved these filters.

The history can now be filtered by one or more entities, by all entities of
one or more areas, or by all entities of one or more devices.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/history-panel.png' alt='Screenshot demonstrating the history panel; it is now possible to select what you want to see'>

This is super helpful, as you can now view the history of all entities in,
for example, your living room area quick and easy.

{% my history badge %}

## Easily convert values to booleans in templates

If you are into templates, [@pyos] has a surprise for you: We now have a `bool`
function that can be used as a filter too!

If you are a bit into coding, this is not the standard `bool()`, but one that
is very specific for Home Assistant, making it very useful.

This `bool` method converts a value into a boolean and considers
Home Assistant's specific rules for truthy values. Some examples: `"on"` will
be considered true, and `"disabled"` will be considered false.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-07/bool.png' alt='Screenshot demonstrating auto-complete for MDI icons in the code editors'>

Using `bool` as a filter and combined with and [`iif`](/docs/configuration/templating/#immediate-if-iif)
filter, you can quickly change, for example, binary sensors values into any
text you'd like.

For more information, check out our [Templating documentation].

- [@kingy444] added support for Top/Down, Bottom/Up to [Hunter Douglas PowerView].
  Additionally, buttons to calibrate and jog (identify) have been added. [@bdraco]
  added support for polling in case the device is mains powered.
- Thanks to [@thrawnarn], you can now send polls via [Telegram bot]!
- The [Home Connect] integration now has whole collection of new services
  that can be used to control and configure options of device programs.
  Really nice, [@BraveChicken1]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Python 3.10" %}

Home Assistant now ships with Python 3.10 for the following installation methods:

- Home Assistant Operating System
- Home Assistant Container
- Home Assistant Supervised

You don't have to do anything; this will all happen automatically. However,
this might be a breaking change in case you are using custom integration
that does not support Python 3.10 yet.

([@pvizeli] - [#73830]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#73830]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73830

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Bluetooth (multiple integrations)" %}

Home Assistant is upgrading to Python 3.10 this release and comes
with a breaking change affecting multiple integrations.

Known affected integrations at the time of writing:

- [BeeWi SmartClim BLE sensor](/integrations/beewi_smartclim)
- [Bluetooth Tracker](/integrations/bluetooth_tracker)
- [Elgato Avea](/integrations/avea)
- [EQ3 Bluetooth Smart Thermostats](/integrations/eq3btsmart)
- [Leviton Decora](/integrations/decora)
- [Mi Flora](/integrations/miflora)
- [Switchmate SimplySmart Home](/integrations/switchmate)
- [Zengge](/integrations/zengge)

These integrations rely on the `bluepy` and `pybluez` libraries, which no longer
work in newer versions of Python. `bluepy` has seen its last update in
[December 2018](https://pypi.org/project/bluepy/#history) and hasn't
kept up with changes in the Python world.
[Similar story](https://pypi.org/project/pybluez/#history) with `pybluez`.

We can't mitigate this issue. If you are using one of these integrations,
these will no longer work. We rather wanted to see a non-breaking solution,
but we saw no backward compatible path or other solutions to aid this.

If you would like to help fix or upgrade one of these integrations, we
would be grateful. We recommend migrating these integrations onto the
[Bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/) library instead.

([@pvizeli] - [#73830]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#73830]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73830

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Entity filters (multiple integrations)" %}

All entity filters, as used by the following integrations:

- [Apache Kafka](/integrations/apache_kafka)
- [Azure Event Hub](/integrations/azure_event_hub)
- [Google Pub/Sub](/integrations/google_pubsub)
- [History](/integrations/history)
- [InfluxDB](/integrations/influxdb)
- [Logbook](/integrations/logbook)
- [Recorder](/integrations/recorder)

Have been adjusted to make entity filters handle includes stronger than excludes.

Filters are now applied as follows when there are domain and glob includes
(may also have excludes):

- Entity listed in entities include: include
- Otherwise, entity listed in entities exclude: exclude
- Otherwise, entity matches glob include: include
- Otherwise, entity matches glob exclude: exclude
- Otherwise, entity matches domain include: include
- Otherwise: exclude

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#74080]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/74080

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Weather (multiple integrations)" %}

This applies to all (weather) integrations providing weather entities.

Previously the units for Weather had not been corresponding correctly with
the documentation. These units are now aligned for pressure and wind speed:

- If the unit system is metric, the default pressure unit is `hPa`,
  and the default wind speed unit is `km/h`.
- If the unit system is imperial, the default pressure unit is `inHg`,
  and the default wind speed unit is `mi/h`.

[#73441]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73441

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Eight Sleep" %}

The Eight Sleep integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. Configuring Eight Sleep via YAML configuration
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration
after upgrading.

[#71095]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/71095

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Glances" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Glances
integration has been removed.

Glances is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@engrbm87] - [#72706]) ([documentation](/integrations/glances))

[@engrbm87]: https://github.com/engrbm87
[#72706]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72706

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Calendars" %}

The Google Calendar `google.scan_for_calendars` service has been removed.
Similar functionality can be achieved with the
`homeassistant.reload_config_entry` service, which will reload the
integration and load all new calendars from the API.

([@allenporter] - [#73010]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#73010]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73010

---

The Google Calendar `add_event` service is deprecated and will be removed in
a future Home Assistant release.

A new service `create_event` with equivalent functionality is its replacement,
which is an entity-based service that takes an entity as a target
(rather than a Google Calendar ID).

([@allenporter] - [#72473]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#72473]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72473

---

Google Calendars no longer supports entity customizations in the UI
when `google_calendars.yaml` specifies the same entity multiple times.

([@allenporter] - [#73715]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#73715]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73715

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hunter Douglas PowerView" %}

Top Down/Bottom Up shades will now have an entity to control each motor.
You will need to manually remove any old entities by selecting the unavailable
entities from the Home Assistant Interface, selecting "REMOVE ENTITY", and
then confirming the removal by clicking "REMOVE".

- If you have automations to set shade position based on entity ID, you will
  need to reconfigure these as the new entities will be named differently.
- If you only have automations set to trigger scenes you **do not** need to
  reconfigure automations.

[#62788]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/62788

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Islamic Prayer Times" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Islamic Prayer Times
integration has been removed.

Islamic Prayer Times is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@engrbm87] - [#7287248332]) ([documentation](/integrations/islamic_prayer_times))

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Kostal Plenticore" %}

The Kostal Plenticore now has number entities. Two existing sensors entities
have been promoted to this platform: "Battery min Soc" and
"Battery min Home Consumption".

If you use these sensors entities in your automation, scripts, or dashboards,
you will need to adjust these for this change.

{% details "LG Soundbars" %}

The LG Soundbars integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. The automatic discovery of the integration via legacy discovery
has been removed.

This change has no possible migration path; therefore, if you use this
integration, you will have to re-add it manually via the user interface.

{% details "Life360" %}

### Overview

The Life360 integration has been converted from the old "legacy"
implementation (which uses `known_devices.yaml`) to the newer entity based
design, similar to what was done back in the 0.94.0 release to many other
device tracker integrations.

Due to this change, all your existing Life360 entities will become
non-functional, and there will be new entities, with different entity IDs,
that _are_ functional.

### Steps to replace old entities with new ones

1. Edit the `known_devices.yaml` file in your configuration directory to
remove any Life360-related entries. Or, if there are only Life360 entries in
this file, simply delete the file entirely.
2. Restart Home Assistant. All the old, non-functional Life360 entities
should now be gone. (If you are still seeing the old entities, try refreshing
your browser.)
3. Go to the Entities page (under Settings -> Devices & Services -> Entities)
and change the entity IDs for the new Life360 entities as desired.

### Removed/changed functionality

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Life360
integration has been removed.

Life360 is now configured via the UI. Any "advanced" options in
YAML configuration will be imported. Once the migration is complete,
any `life360` entries in YAML configuration should be removed.

The following options are no longer supported:

- `circles`
- `members`
- `error_threshold`
- `warning_threshold`
- `max_update_wait` (including the `life360_update_overdue` & `life360_update_restored` events)
- `show_as_state: moving`

Additionally, the following entity attributes have been changed:

- Renamed: `battery` -> `battery_level`
- Removed: `moving`, `raw_speed`

If you have been using these attributes in your automations or script, you'll
need to adapt them to this change.

{% details "Met Office" %}

Met Office doesn't provide precise visibility distance, only ranges - i.e.,
something like "Very good - 20-40 km".

This doesn't fit into the weather entity model, so it's now removed.
The old value is still available in a separate sensor provided
by this integration.

{% details "Nest" %}

The Nest authentication method called "Desktop", "Installed App" or "OOB" auth
has been [deprecated](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html#disallowed-oob)
by Google and is scheduled to break existing users in October.

As a result, the Home Assistant Nest integration setup has been streamlined
to help make the transition easier for users. See the integration
documentation for details.

The configuration of the OAuth application credentials for the Nest integration
has migrated to configuration via the UI. Configuring Nest OAuth application
credentials via YAML configuration has been deprecated and will be removed in
a future Home Assistant release.

If you were already using Web Auth, your existing Nest application credentials
in the YAML configuration are automatically imported on upgrade to this release;
and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration after upgrading.

Radio Thermostat's hold mode is now configured using a switch. This replaces
the original YAML configuration option named `hold_temp`.

The integration now only synchronizes time when loaded if the hold mode
is not active. Synchronizing the time when the hold mode is active causes
the hold mode to disable unexpectedly.

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The new disk sensors pull from completely different data than the old ones.
They should be largely compatible for functionality, but orphaned sensors may
still be created. Any orphaned sensors can be safely deleted.

The sensors' naming format has also changed to match what is shown in UniFi
Protect. Additionally, the extra state attribute for the model has
been completely removed since now the slot numbers match what UniFi
Protect displays.

Entities that provided an "edit" configuration interface for Protect devices
(like the HDR Switch or Recording Mode Select) have all now been replaced by
regular sensor entities; if you do not have write access to that UniFi Protect
Device.

These switches, select entities, etc., never actually worked previously since
the user did not have permission to change them, but you could read the status.

Any entities that are orphaned by this can be safely deleted.
