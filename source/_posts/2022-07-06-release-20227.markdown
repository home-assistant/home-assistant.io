## Improved stability and performance, and Python 3.10

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve on story
- Spelling/grammar
- Something about start up reliability improvements
- Make it more to the point?
- Maybe split YAML from JSON

To add/process into this maybe:
- Fix setup race when config entry is in a setup retry state ([@bdraco] - [#73145]) (noteworthy)
- Prime platform.uname cache at startup to fix blocking subprocess in the event loop ([@bdraco] - [#73975]) (noteworthy)
- Check if requirements are installed in the executor ([@bdraco] - [#71611]) (noteworthy)

{% enddetails %}

The quest of improving the performance of Home Assistant continues. Normally,
we have a section at the end of our release notes, where we tell you about the
performance improvements that have been made. This release, it is a big deal.

For many releases [@bdraco] has been analyzing every single aspect of
Home Assistant and manages to make it faster every single release, but
an exceptional progress has been made this release!

The first one is that our YAML & JSON tooling has been optimized/replaced,
with faster libraries and methods. If you use lots of YAML configuration,
you will seriously notice this a lot when starting Home Assistant or
when reloading things like your automations 🚀. JSON is used a lot internally
and for communication with the frontend or APIs, making things A LOT snappier.

Devices with an integration error during startup, that are able to self recover,
will now do that instantly as soon as the device is discovered.

We now use an better and faster encryption method for the HomeKit Accessory
Protocol (HAP). This improves the performance of the HomeKit, HomeKit Controller,
and Apple TV integrations and prepares Home Assistant for iOS 16.

Lastly, [@pvizeli] has been working hard to ship Home Assistant on Python 3.10!
Which also brings quite an performance improvement. If you are running the Home
Assistant Operating System or use our container installation method, you will
automatically get this, no need to do anything. 🚀

## Update firmware of your Z-Wave devices directly from Home Assistant

{% details "TODO" %}

- Update screenshots, maybe an animation?
- Add manual firmware update support for zwave-js devices (#12910) @raman325 (frontend)
- Improve story
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

You can now install and update firmware of your Z-Wave devices directly from
within Home Assistant! On the device page there is now the ability to
upload a firmware to your Z-Wave device.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7243222/173172258-cd6a4bd8-4ead-49cf-a96e-42084b9d7246.png' alt='Upload firmware to your Z-Wave device'>

Temporary screenshot. Update in progress...
</p>

## Change the any weather unit to your preference

{% details "TODO" %}

- Insert screenshot
- Change (any of the) units weather entities
- Change units on number entities that represent a temperature
- Improve on story
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

You can now change the units weather entities use, for each of the weather
entities individually. And that is not just temperature, but for all of
the values a weather entity provides.

So, you like your barometric pressure unit to be in mbar instead of hPa?
Or maybe use m/s instead of km/h for wind speed? No problem!

As an added bonus, this same unit changing feature was added to the
number entities that represent a temperature. Unit conversion/changing for
these number entites has also been added.

## Optional labels for gauge cards

{% details "TODO" %}

- Not sure if we should keep this here, might also go into the noteworthy section
- Replace screenshot
- Improve story
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

The guage card can now optionally have labels attached to its segments.
This will cause the label to be shown, instead of the numeric sensor value.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1550962/173711768-56958cf9-3012-4b6d-aa57-b1e0ee0bf046.png' alt='Gauge card showing a label instead of a value'>
Temporary screenshot. Gauge card showing a label instead of a value
</p>

## Auto-complete of MDI icons in template editors

{% details "TODO" %}

- Not merged yet! https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/13022
- Not sure if we should keep this here, might also go into the noteworthy section
- Replace screenshot
- Improve story
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

All of our template editors in the frontend, now have auto-completions for
MDI icons. Just start typing `mdi:` and it will try to help you out finding
the exact icon you want to use in your template.

Just like the normal icon picker, it support searching on part of the iconn
ame, or its aliases. Additionally, it will show a little preview of the icon
you are about to select, so you know you got the right one.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/176032468-b7ac047f-76ce-442e-b3ba-516a811399f1.png' alt='MDI auto completions in all code editors'>
Temporary screenshot. Auto-completion of MDI icons insider an template editor.

## Filter the history using a target selector

{% details "TODO" %}

- Needs a different title, this one it technical
- Add story
- Replace screenshot
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

The history panel now has a target select, allow you to select the area(s),
device(s), entitie(s), or a combination of those, that you want to see.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663432/176453456-d244f1ee-bf7f-4243-8a2e-204e3f3f5271.png' alt='In the history panel it is now possible to select what you want to see'>
Temporary screenshot. Target selector in the history panel.
</p>

## Easily convert values to booleans in templates

{% details "TODO" %}

- Not sure if we should keep this as a chapter at this point, can go into
  noteworhy too.
- Improve story
- Better examples
- Spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

If you are into templates, [@pyos] has a surprise for you: We now have `bool`
function that can be used as a filter too!

If you are a bit into coding, this is not the normal `bool()`, but one that
is very specific for Home Assistant; making it very useful.

This `bool` method converts a value into a boolean, taking into account
Home Assistant's specific rules for truthy values. Some examples, `"on"` will
be considered true, and `"disabled"` will be considered false.

Combined with things like our [`iff`](/docs/configuration/templating/#immediate-if-iif)
filter, you can do a lot of useful things with this.

```jinja2
states("binary_sensor.door") | bool(none) | iif("Open", "Closed", "I dunno")
```

## Breaking Changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 74172

{% enddetails %}

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Python 3.10" %}

Home Assistant now ships with Python 3.10 for the following installation methods:

- Home Assistant Operating System
- Home Assistant Container
- Home Assistant Supervised

You don't have to do anything, this will all happen automatically. However,
this might be a breaking change in case you are using custom integration
that do not support Python 3.10 yet.

([@pvizeli] - [#73830]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#73830]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73830

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Bluetooth (multiple integrations)" %}

Home Assistant upgrading to Python 3.10 this release, comes
with a breaking change affecting multiple integrations.

Known affacted integrations at the time of writing:

- [BeeWi SmartClim BLE sensor](/integrations/beewi_smartclim)
- [Elgato Avea](/integrations/avea)
- [EQ3 Bluetooth Smart Thermostats](/integrations/eq3btsmart)
- [Leviton Decora](/integrations/decora)
- [Mi Flora](/integrations/miflora)
- [Zengge](/integrations/zengge)

These integrations rely on the `bluepy` library, which no longer works
in newer versions of Python. `bluepy` has seen its last update in
[December 2018](https://pypi.org/project/bluepy/#history) and hasn't
kept up with changes in the Python world.

It is not possible for us to mitigate this issue. If you are using
one of these integration, these will no longer work.

If you like to help out to fix or upgrade one of these integrations, we
would be grateful. We recommend migrating these integrations onto the
[Bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/) libary instead.

([@pvizeli] - [#73830]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder/#configure-filter))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#73830]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73830

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Entity filters (multiple integrations)" %}

All entity filters, as used by the following integrations:

- [Apache Kafka](/integrations/apache_kafka)
- [Azure Event Hub](/integrations/azure_event_hub)
- [Google Pub/Sub](/integrations/google_pubsub)
- [History](/integrations/history)
- [InfluxDB](/integrations/influxdb)
- [Logbook](/integrations/logbook)
- [Recorder](/integrations/recorder)

Have been adjusted to make entity filters handli includes stronger than excludes.

Filters are now applied as follows when there are domain and/or glob includes
(may also have excludes):

- Entity listed in entities include: include
- Otherwise, entity listed in entities exclude: exclude
- Otherwise, entity matches glob include: include
- Otherwise, entity matches glob exclude: exclude
- Otherwise, entity matches domain include: include
- Otherwise: exclude

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Eight Sleep" %}

The Eight Sleep integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. Configuring Eight Sleep via YAML configuration
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration

[#72706]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72706

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Calendars" %}

The Google Calendar `google.scan_for_calendars` service has been removed.
Similar functionality can be achieved with the
`homeassistant.reload_config_entry` service, which will reload the
integration and load all new calendars from the API.

([@allenporter] - [#73010]) ([documentation](/integrations/google))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#73010]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73010

---

The Google Calendar `add_event` service is deprecated, and will be removed in
a future Home Assistant release.

A new service `create_event` with equivalent functionality is its replacement,
which is an entity based service that takes an entity as a target
(rather than a Google Calendar ID).

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Kostal Plenticore" %}

The Kostal Plenticore now has number entities. Two existing sensors entities
have been promoted to this platform: "Battery min Soc" and
"Battery min Home Consumption".

If you used these sensors entities in your automation, scripts, or dashboards
you will need to adjust these for this change.

[#72761]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72761

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nest" %}

The Nest authentication method called "Desktop", "Installed App" or "OOB" auth
has been [deprecated](https://developers.googleblog.com/2022/02/making-oauth-flows-safer.html#disallowed-oob)
by Google and scheduled to break existing users in October.

As a result, the Home Assistant Nest integration setup has been streamlined
to help make the transition easier for users. See the integration
documentation for details.

The configuration of the OAuth application credentials for the Nest integration
has migrated to configuration via the UI. Configuring Nest OAuth application
credentials via YAML configuration has been deprecated and will be removed in
a future Home Assistant release.

If you were already using Web Auth, your existing Nest application credentials
in the YAML configuration are automatically imported on upgrade to this release;

---

Radio Thermostat's hold mode is now configured using a switch. This replaces
the original YAML configuration option named `hold_temp`.

The integration now only synchronizes time when loaded if the hold mode
is not active. Synchronizing the time when the hold mode is active causes

has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration
after upgrading.

{% details "SkyBell" %}

The SkyBell integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. Configuring SkyBell via YAML configuration
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration
after upgrading.

After upgrading, each Skybell will now have a device for each doorbell.
Also, it now has become unnecessary to prefix all entities with "SkyBell",
this may change you existing entities after upgrading and you need to adjust
your automation, scripts and dashboard for this change.

The following SkyBell entity attributes have been split out into their own
sensors: last motion event, last button event, last check in, motion threshold,
video profile, wifi ssid, wifi status.

If you rely on these attributes in your automations or scripts, you will need
to adapt them to this change.

{% details "SmartThings" %}

The following power entity attributes from the climate entity for SmartThings
Air Conditioner have been removed and added as separate sensors:

- `power_consumption_start`
- `power_consumption_end`
- `power_consumption_power`
- `power_consumption_energy`

If you are currently using these attributes in your automation or scripts,
you'll need to adapt them to this change.

{% details "System Bridge" %}

- This integration now requires System Bridge 3.1.2 and above. Any older
  version will no longer work.
- BIOS Version, Idle, System, and User Load sensors have been removed.
  These are no longer available from System Bridge data modules.
- Command service has been removed. This has been removed from System Bridge
  due to potential security issues.
- Open path and URL are now separate services. If you are using the
  old `system_bridge.open` service, you will need to update your
  automation to use the new service(s).
- GPU entities are from a new source so may have changed names slightly.
  Any automations using these entities may need to be updated.
- GPU fan speed is now measured in RPM instead of %.

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The new disk sensors pull from completely different data then the old ones.
They should be largely compatible for functionality, but orphaned sensors may
still be created. Any orphaned sensors can be safely deleted.

The naming format for the sensors have changed as well to match what is showed
in UniFi Protect. Additionally, the extra state attribute for the model has
been completely removed since now the slot numbers match up with what UniFi
Protect displays.

[@AngellusMortis]: https://github.com/AngellusMortis
[#73197]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/73197

---

Entities that provided an "edit" configuration interface for Protect devices
(like the HDR Switch or Recording Mode Select) have all now been replaced by
regular sensor entities; if you do not have write access to that UniFi Protect
Device.

These switches, select entities, etc. never actually worked previously since
the user did not have permission to change them, but you could read the status.

Any entities that are orphaned by this can be safely deleted.

{% details "Universal Media Player" %}

An "order of importance" between the states of the children of
Universal Media Player has been added. The active media player might change
if some of the children are in "playing" and "paused" states,
depending on the children order.

{% details "VeSync" %}

The `air_quality` and `filter_life` attributes have been removed from the fan
entities. These attributes have been replaced by dedicated sensor entities.

If you are currently using these attributes in your automation or scripts,
you'll need to adapt them to this change.

Vesync switches which support energy monitoring will have their:

- Voltage attribute moved from the switch entity to a dedicated Voltage Sensor
  entity
- Weekly, monthly and yearly moved from the switch entity attributes into new
  energy sensors. 

If you used these entity attributes in your automation or scripts, you'll need
to adapt them to this change.

{% details "Weather" %}

This applies to all (weather) integrations providing weather entities.

Previously the units for Weather had not been corresponding correctly with
the documentation. These units are now aligned for pressure and wind speed:

- If unit system is metric, default pressure unit is `hPa` and the default wind
  speed unit is `km/h`.
- If unit system is imperial, default pressure unit is `inHg` and the default
  wind speed unit is `mi/h`.
