## Blueprint of the week

Do you have a number of domain names and would you like to track when an SSL
certificate expires? Then you could try [bkbilly's](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/bkbilly)
blueprint that automatically sends you a notification when a sensor exceeds your set threshold value.
[Try it out!](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/certificate-expiration/280125)

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/certificate-expiration/280125" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-03-12-community-highlights/blueprint.png'

## Birthday cake

Happy birthday to [adlawton](https://www.reddit.com/user/adlawton/)! ðŸ¥³ For his birthday,
his wife baked this great Home Assistant cake and also gave him a [Home Assistant Blue](/blue).

<blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created="1615556016"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/lz5s6s/my_wife_decided_to_bake_me_a_cake_to_go_along/">My wife decided to bake me a cake to go along with my birthday present this year. Can't wait to fire this thing up!</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant">r/homeassistant</a></blockquote>

Hopefully, the cake tasted delicious and have fun with your Blue!

## ePaper display

[maxmacstn](https://github.com/maxmacstn) shared a really cool project on our
Home Assistant [subreddit][reddit] page. It allows you to display sensor data from,
for example, a room on an ePaper display. It works with ESPHome and you can also neatly
finish this with a 3D printed case.

## Hass Workstation Service

For those who would like to read their webcam status on a Windows machine, there is
finally a solution! [sleevezipper](https://github.com/sleevezipper) has written a program
that you can install on windows and that can send data to your Home Assistant instance over
MQTT, in the background as a service.

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://gh-card.dev/repos/sleevezipper/hass-workstation-service.svg?link_target=_blank"></object>

        alt="UI of the workstation service program on Windows"
        style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;'
    />
</a>

You can finally switch the lights automatically when you are in an online meeting ðŸ˜‰

_Note: If youâ€™re on MacOS, you can achieve the same using the [Home Assistant Companion app for MacOS][companion]._

## Smart pet feeder

Would you like to automate feeding your pets? Then try the project of
[Sokolsok](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sokolsok/), who has turned it into a very cool
project with its own PCB and 3D printed design.
