Today we are excited to announce our next Works with Home Assistant partner: Third Reality!

Third Reality, Inc. is a smart home products company that has been working with Home Assistant for quite a long time but is now making it official. As a partner, Third Reality and Nabu Casa will be working together to ensure the best experience for connecting Third Reality Zigbee devices to Home Assistant.

Third Reality devices will connect and integrate into Home Assistant easily using the Zigbee Home Automation integration (Zigbee stick required). This means that the devices operate completely locally and state changes coming from the device are instantaneously picked up by Home Assistant. This allows for the best user experience when building a smart home.
