{% note %}

**Welcome to the beta release notes for Home Assistant 2024.9** üéâ

<br />

Please note that these release notes are a work in progress. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We will be
completing them over the next couple of days. Not all features might be final
yet, and some features _**may not** make it into the final release_.

<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.
You can find our issue trackers and the reported issues during beta here:

<br />

- [Report(ed) beta **dashboards/UI/frontend** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/milestone/123)
- [Report(ed) beta **integrations/automations/backend/core** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/milestone/686)
- [Report(ed) beta **documentation** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/milestone/130)

üôè When reporting issues, **make sure to mention the exact beta version you are
running** in the issue description. This will help us identify and track the
issue correctly. Read more about [reporting issues here](/help/reporting_issues/).

<br />

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority. üîù

Home Assistant 2024.9! üéâ

For many of us in the community based in the northern hemisphere we've been taking advantage of the nicer weather to take a little time off. Home Assistant releases have continued to grow for some time, and this one might not be as gargantuan in size as previous releases, but it still packs some really cool features and announcements.

This release includes bigger sections, smarter energy monitoring, and a new LLM option. We‚Äôve added [five](#new-integrations) new integrations, along with [one](#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui) existing integration being added to the UI. On top of all that, we‚Äôve announced a new Works with Home Assistant partner, and the culmination of a project to ensure our project is truly open source.

We hope you've been able to enjoy some time in, and away, from your smart home this month as well.

Enjoy the (beta) release!

## Sections go BIG

In the drive to give our users more customization and organization options for their dashboards, we've added some new options to our Sections view that really lets us take big advantage of [resizable cards](/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard). These powerful customization features can affect the [predictability of where cards or sections will go](/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections), especially when switching between desktop and mobile views, and we have found it works best with large cards. As always, the choice of how to use it is up to you.

<img src="/images/blog/2024-09/sections-go-big.png" alt="Temporary screenshot">

### Wider sections

Sections can be expanded to span multiple sections. Now you can, for example, have your security camera feed span two sections or have a massive three-section wide map.

Cards and sections will continue to follow the [Z-Grid rules](/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections), which can lead to blank spaces if the new wider sections don't fit on a specific part of the screen. If you don't like those blank spaces between sections, you can choose a _dense_ layout. A dense section layout option will attempt to follow the Z-Grid rules, but will fill blank spaces whenever possible. This can affect the order and predictability of your sections, but will maximize screen real estate.

When switching to smaller screens, these larger sections will revert to one section wide (if this causes issues for certain big cards, we would recommend using our device [visibility settings](/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards)).

### Full span cards

Larger sections mean larger cards. Instead of just stretching out the layout of a card, there is also a new option on cards to have them always use the full width of the section.

## Tracking your untracked energy

In April, we introduced a [new energy graph for individual devices](/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#new-energy-graph-for-individual-devices) in our energy dashboard. This allows you to aggregate all your energy monitoring into one graph, giving you a quick way to see your house's biggest energy-using devices. Big thanks to [@karwosts](https://github.com/karwosts), the original creator of this graph, who has now updated it.

<img src="/images/blog/2024-09/untracked-energy.png" alt="Temporary screenshot">

We can't all have energy tracking for every device, and if you have whole-home energy tracking (like a smart meter or [something more DIY](/home-energy-management)) the updated graph will calculate the difference and show your home's untracked usage. So hop onto your [energy dashboard](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/energy/) and start to tackle your phantom energy load.

## LLM agent options grow

When we added the ability to use [Large Language Models (LLMs)](/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dipping-our-toes-in-the-world-of-ai-using-llms) in our Voice Assistant, it began with a limited number of conversation agents. These included the cloud-based  [OpenAI](/components/openai_conversation/) and [Google AI](/components/google_generative_ai_conversation/) integrations, along with the locally-run [Ollama](/integrations/ollama/) integration. All three can now control the devices in your home.

[@Shulyaka](https://github.com/Shulyaka) has now added another cloud option with [Anthropic](/integrations/anthropic) - thanks again for giving us another option for experimenting with AI in Home Assistant. Setting it up can be a little different than other conversation agents so take a look at the [documents](/integrations/anthropic) if you're interested.

## Open source compliance

We have put a lot of work into making sure that Home Assistance is truly open source, from top to bottom. This means ensuring that every library our integrations rely on uses the compliant license. We're now at more than 2,800 integrations, so as you can imagine, this was not a small task. Working with code owners and library developers, we have painstakingly checked that every library is now using an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/license).

This might seem like a small procedural thing, but it is critical to keep integrations and Home Assistant functional far into the future. If you're not aware, libraries are what many device and service integrations rely on to function, by calling in additional protocol specific code that [purposely](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api_lib_index/) sits outside of the Home Assistant project. If an individual or corporation can no longer maintain libraries, a proper open source license allows it to be picked up and continued by others.

## Integrations

Thanks to our community for keeping pace with the new {% term integrations %}
and improvements to existing ones! You're all awesome ü•∞

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

You can now add a number [template helper] from the UI Thanks [@dougiteixeira]!

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **Asterisk Call Detail Records** and **Asterisk Voicemail**. Previously
  deprecated and now removed. They have been using a deprecated mailbox feature
  that is no longer available.

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Proximity" %}

In [2024.2 we introduced new sensor entities](/blog/2024/02/07/release-20242/#revamped-proximity-integration)
to the [Proximity](/integrations/proximity) {% term integration %} and¬†therefore deprecated the `proximity` entity.

Now this deprecated `proximity` entity has been removed.
