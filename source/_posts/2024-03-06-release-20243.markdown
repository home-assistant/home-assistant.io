## Dashboard sections view

A brand new, experimental, view has been added this release: Sections!

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/d1b9f4d8-3d00-42a1-8479-0363e3b740e6' alt='Temporary image that needs replacement.'>

## Dungeons and Dragons

Lorem ipsum

## Running script from your dashboard with user input

Scripts in Home Assistant allow you to capture a sequence of actions and choices in a reusable way. Scripts are extra powerful because they can have input fields, which allow you to send in data for when the script runs.

Script fields can be defined in the script editor and show up when you call the script in your automation. In this release, script fields will be available in the more info dialog when tapping on a script in the dashboard. This allows you to provide the input fields and run the script, unlocking a whole new dimension of possibilities.

<lite-youtube videoid="Ulkl1L8F1L4" videotitle="Calling scripts from the dashboard"></lite-youtube>

To accompany this new functionality, we've created two blueprints as examples of what you could want to add to your dashboard:

**Announce message**: This blueprint allows you to create an announce script for your dashboard that is pre-configured to a specific media player and text-to-speech engine. When activated, it will ask the user for the message to play.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/announce-text-to-speech-on-media-player/699186" %}

**Add to to-do list**: This blueprint allows you to create a script to add an item to a to-do list that is pre-configured to a specific to-do list. When activated, it will ask the user for the item to add.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/add-to-do-item/699193" %}

## New energy graph

A new graph has been added on the energy dashboard by [@karwosts]. You can now monitor your devices energy consumption through time.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/47c83332-aa7d-424a-bd00-6ed23b11f000' alt='Temporary image that needs replacement.'>


## New sentences for Assist

Assists has been expanded with new intent sentences, allowing you to control
even more devices and services.

Support for valves has been added. You can now ask it to adjust the position
of a valve to, for example, 50%, or just open or close a valve completely.

Covers support has been extended, and it now can control the position of
covers, for example, "open the blinds 50%".

No need to worry if you found a dusty spot in your home, starting the vacuum
is now also a new capability. Or, in case you are annoyed by the noise of the
vacuum, you can also ask it to return to base.

The biggest set of changes is for media players. You can now ask it to play,
pause, unpause, and to fast-forward to the next item. But not just that, you
can also control the volume.

## Disabling the remotely enabling of Home Assistant Remote UI

If you are using [Home Assistant Cloud](https://nabucasa.com), you can access
your Home Assistant instance remotely using the Remote UI feature.

If this feature is for some reason disabled and you are currently not at home,
you can enable the Remote UI feature remotely, by logging in into your [Nabu Casa
account](https://account.nabucasa.com/), and request your Home Assistant instance to turn it on.

Feedback from the community has shown that this feature is not always desired,
and this release adds a new option to disable the remotely enabling of the
Remote UI feature.

## Translating states in your templates

Are you using templates to send notification in automations? If so,
[@PiotrMachowski] might just have added something you need this release!

He added a new template methods to translate entity states right in your
templates! Here is an example:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Untranslated
{{ states("binary_sensor.movement_backyard") }}  # Shows: on
{{ states("sun.sun") }}  # Shows: below_horizon
```
{% endraw %}

The above two example, show the raw state of the entities. However, with the
new `state_translated` method, you can get the state in a human readable form:

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Translated
{{ state_translated("binary_sensor.movement_backyard") }}  # Shows: Detected
{{ state_translated("sun.sun") }}  # Shows: Below horizon
```
{% endraw %}

Even better, it uses the default language of your Home Assistant instance. So,
if you are using Home Assistant in a different language, the translated state
will be in that language.

## Home Assistant boots twice as fast

Every release [@bdraco] improves the performance on some aspect of Home Assistant. It has become so regular that we don't always highlight his enormous efforts there. However, this release is,  it is so noticeable that we wanted to call it out: Home Assistant now boots on average twice as fast! 🚀

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "AEMET" %}

The daily data for the current day wasn't available after midday and
now it will be. Automations and script relying on `day[0]` for checking
next day forecast will have to be adjusted to use `day[1]` instead.

([@Noltari] - [#107795]) ([documentation](/integrations/aemet))

[@Noltari]: https://github.com/Noltari
[#107795]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/107795

{% enddetails %}

{% details "JuiceNet" %}

The JuiceNet integration has been removed.

Enel X has migrated from JuiceNet to JuicePass rendering the JuiceNet integration useless. Background and alternative solutions to the juicenet integration can be found in the related [issue](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/86588).

([@emontnemery] - [#111477])

[#111477]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/111477

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Met.no" %}

The met.no integration previously created two entities for each configured
location, one entity which provided daily weather forecasts and one entity
which provided hourly forecasts.

The met.no integration now only creates a single entity which provides
both daily and hourly weather forecasts.

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#97023]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97023

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

Aux heat, which was deprecated in Home Assistant Core 2023.9,
is now removed from MQTT climate.

([@jbouwh] - [#109513]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#109513]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109513

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

For Z-Wave `climate` entities, the behavior of the `climate.turn_on` service
has changed. Previously, the service would act in the following order depending
on whether the corresponding conditions were met:

1. If the entity supported the `off` mode and exactly one additional mode,
   `climate.turn_on` would set the mode to the additional mode.
2. If conditions for 1 were not met and at least one of the following modes is
   available, the service would set the mode to the first mode it found
   in specified order: `heat_cool`, `heat`, `cool`.
3. If conditions for 1 and 2 were not met, the service would silently do nothing.

Now, the service follows the following behavior in order:

1. If the entity supports the `resume` thermostat mode, it will be used to
   restore the last mode you used before the entity was turned off.
2. If the condition for 1 isn't met and the entity was turned off in
   Home Assistant, and Home Assistant wasn't restarted, Home Assistant
   remembers the last "on" mode and will set it to that mode. Home Assistant
   will be unable to set the entity to the previous mode if Home Assistant
   starts with the entity already in `off` mode since the integration will
   not know what the previous mode was.
3. If conditions for 1 and 2 are not met and at least one of the following
   modes is available, the service sets the mode to the first mode it finds
   in specified order: `heat_cool`, `heat`, `cool`
   (no change to condition 2 above).
4. If conditions for 1, 2, and 3 are not met, the mode will be set to the first
   supported mode it finds (e.g. `dry` or `fan_only`).
