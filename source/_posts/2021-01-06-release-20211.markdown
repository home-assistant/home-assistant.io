<img src='/images/blog/2021-01/social.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>

We said goodbye to 2020, which was a weird and wild year. 2020 will be
remembered because of the awful pandemic, that hopefully will get under control
in 2021.

We wish you, your family, friends and everyone around you, safety, health,
happiness and countless blessings for 2021!

Happy New Year!

Kicking off the year with Home Assistant Core 2021.1!

Now don't get too excited. The 2020.12 release was jam-packed, and most of us
enjoyed the holidays with our loved ones. Furthermore, we didn't have a full
release cycle, this one was shorter than usual. This is due to the delaying of
the previous release cycle (for the conference) and the introduction of the new
release cycle (monthly now).

As a result of that, this release starts 2021 slowly, with a light release.
No big new features, no new integrations. Just fixes, tweaking and tuning.

Besides, I'm curious, what is your smart home new years resolution?
Let me know in the comments!

Enjoy the release!

## In memoriam of Villhellm

It is with sadness that we announce that one of the Jedis in our Discord Server,
[@Villhellm](https://www.github.com/villhellm) (William), who had been actively
involved with the Home Assistant community for a number of years, had passed
away right before Christmas of 2020 at the age of 27.

He had been an active member in forums, and other discord servers related to
Home Automation (Dr. Zzs, DigiblurDIY, and many more.)

We want to take a moment to recognize his efforts and the support he had
provided to the HA community, and may he rest in peace.

Some of his friends have set up a [GoFundMe](https://gofund.me/f14a5a4a) account
to help his surviving wife and family members. We now have an opportunity to
help his family get through these difficult times.

We thank you for your support!

## Home Assistant Conference Videos

A couple of weeks ago, the Home Assistant Conference of 2020 took place. We had
quite a few messages and requests for making all talks held at the conference
available for viewing.

We have started the process of making those available on our
[YouTube Channel][channel]. So, if you haven't done it already, go to our
channel and subscribe and you'll be notified when we make another talk
available.

All videos of the conference will be added to the
[Home Assistant Conference 2020 playlist][playlist] on YouTube as well.

## Other noteworthy changes

This release has no big new features, but we do have quite a bit of tweaks
that are definitely noteworthy to mention.

- [@spacegaier] removed the "No Area" from the device tables, reducing the
  clutter in those lists.

  areas are now sent to [Google Assistant][google_assistant docs] as room
  hints.
- [Rachio][rachio docs] now has pause and resume services, thanks to [@brg468].

  starting by giving the option to display pickup types by their human-friendly
  names. Thanks, [@bachya]!
- [@postlund] rewrote the [Apple TV][apple_tv docs] integration for 2020.12,
  but he is not stopping! Besides some fixes, he extended the device information
  and added some attributes.
- The [SQL Sensor][sql docs] now supports MSSQL, thanks to [@dgomes]!
- Support for climate devices with a temperature range, has been added to the
  [HomeKit controller][homekit_controller docs] integration.
  Thanks, [@thevoltagesource]!
- The [MQTT][mqtt docs] integration discovery feature, now has support for
  device trackers, which has been added by [@PeteBa].
- Sending animations using the [Telegram Bot][telegram_bot docs] is now
  possible with the new animation service added by [@tofuSCHNITZEL].
- If you have a Xiaomi Miio vacuum cleaner with a mop function, this release
  added status for the water box and the mop itself. Thanks, [@JJdeVries]!
- [WeMo][wemo docs] now supports the outdoor plug, thanks [@mattbilodeau]!
- The [Music Player Daemon][mpd docs] integration now shows album art in the
  media player. Looks good [@mweinelt]!

  Australian and neural voice. Thanks [@aque0us]!
- [Google Cloud TTS][google_cloud docs] now has support for SSML
  (Speech Synthesis Markup Language). Thanks, [@lufton]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

<details>
  <summary><b>Météo-France</b></summary>
  <p>

The unit of measurement of the UV sensor was missing and has been added. You
may have to adapt your configuration accordingly, if you were depending on the
unit of this sensor in any automations, scripts or 3rd party data loggers.

([@mbo18] - [#43992]) ([meteo_france docs])

  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Glances</b></summary>
  <p>

Previously, the Glances integration was presuming that all sensors were
temperatures. Now, we can distinguish temperatures, fan speeds and battery
charges.

In consequence, those entities have new Entity IDs, so you should update your
configuration in the UI or in your YAML files.

Previously, they were all suffixed by `_temp`. Now they are suffixed by
`_temperature`, `_fan_speed` and `_charge`.

Examples:

- `sensor.glances_core_0_temp => sensor.glances_core_0_temperature`
- `sensor.glances_battery_temp => sensor.glances_battery_charge`
- `sensor.glances_thinkpad_1_temp => sensor.glances_thinkpad_1_fan_speed`

([@guix77] - [#43500]) ([glances docs])

  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Neato</b></summary>
  <p>

Neato now uses a new authentication method: OAuth2.

If you are an existing Neato user, you will need to update your YAML
configuration, as per the updated [Neato documentation][neato docs]. The
integration will then automatically be migrated.

Vorwerk support is dropped from the neato integration. The parent library still
supports Vorwerk however, the authentication is completely different and
therefore will require a separate integration created.

([@Santobert] - [#44031]) ([neato docs])

  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Tado</b></summary>
  <p>

The Tado Bridge sensor has been removed and replaced by its corresponding device
sensor.

([@Noltari] - [#44475]) ([tado docs])

  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>OpenTherm Gateway</b></summary>
  <p>

This release breaks `binary_sensor` and `sensor` entities of the `opentherm_gw`
integration. More specifically, all existing `binary_sensor` and `sensor`
entities are recreated with a different `entity_id`, `unique_id` and friendly
name.

Some entities are recreated once, others will be recreated twice for different
data sources (boiler and thermostat). All entities that are recreated are
disabled by default.

The old `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities will log a deprecation warning
and change behavior slightly if they are enabled. They will be automatically
removed if they are disabled. Behavioral changes of the old entities may include
a delayed update and a possible change of data source (boiler vs. thermostat)
which may only become apparent when an override is active on the OpenTherm
Gateway.

The `climate` entity is not affected.

The OpenTherm Gateway sits between the thermostat and the boiler and thus deals
with 2 streams of information. Before this release, the status info we received
contained overlapping information from both streams of information, which led
to issues when the gateway was overriding some values.

As of this release, the status is split up in multiple parts to reflect this.
Each part contains the status of its respective information stream. With this
change, we create sensor entities for each stream where necessary.

([@mvn23] - [#43352]) ([opentherm_gw docs])

  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>BMW Connected Drive</b></summary>
  <p>

BMW Connected Drive has been migrated for configuration via the UI.

Your old entries from `configuration.yaml` are automatically imported __once__
for initial setup.

It is recommended to rename the device_tracker of your car(s) in
`config/known_devices.yaml` (you can e.g., add `_old` to the entity name)
before updating, otherwise a second device tracker entity (ending with `_2`)
per car will be created.

After updating, the entity can be removed from known_devices as that will no
longer be used.

([@rikroe] - [#39585]) ([bmw_connected_drive docs])

  </p>
</details>

## Farewell to the following

The following integrations have been removed:

- **Avri** ([@timvancann] - [#44478])

Avri has changed their API and it seems not possible to use the new one.
