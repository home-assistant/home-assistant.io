Last week we hosted the [State of the Open Home](/state-of-the-open-home/) and it included a demo of [Genie](https://genie.stanford.edu).

Genie is an open, privacy-preserving virtual assistant by [Stanford OVAL](https://oval.cs.stanford.edu/). During the impressive demo they showed it's latest capabilities. The demos run on a Baidu speaker with custom firmware and on a Pi Zero. In both cases it connects to the Genie server running as an official Home Assistant add-on to do it's magic.

Genie is the successor to the Almond project. With the help of various grants and sponsors Stanford is working on making Genie ready for general use.
