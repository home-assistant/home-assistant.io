For the 4th edition, I thought it fitted to devote the community highlights to 3D!

_That is actually a lie, the [3rd edition](/blog/2020/02/19/community-highlights/)
would have been much more fitting, but was hijacked by Paulus ;)
At least it's my 3rd community highlight writeup, so that counts, right?_

Ready for some highly inspiring and mind-blowing 3D creations?

## 3D home navigation and control, using Unity

Are you sure you ready? Because Harrie de Groot created a fully navigatable
3D model of his home using Unity, accessible from within Home Assistant.

You really **need** to watch the video below now...

Well done, Harrie! That looks slick!

More details on his creation can be found on the
[Home Assistant Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/3d-home-navigation-control-unity-home-assistant/174972).

## 3D printed interactive floorplan

If you have been around a bit, you might have come across a screenshot of
someone with an interactive floorplan in Home Assistant. [Ryan Connolly](https://twitter.com/rynam0)
took that idea straight into the real world by 3D printing his floorplan,
wired it, and hooked it up Home Assistant.

Talking about taking things into another dimension...

### Getting started with your own 3D floorplan

Ok, so the above two, rather impressive, listings might be a bit out of reach
for the most of us. Still, with some help, you could still achieve some pretty
nice looking 3D floorplans. [Aaron Godfrey](https://github.com/boralyl) wrote a
couple of excellent blog posts on this.

In his [first blog post](https://aarongodfrey.dev/home%20automation/floorplan-in-home-assistant/),
Aaron shows you what his floorplan looks like

</div>

He followed up with two blog posting on how to achieve this:

- [Tips for creating a Floorplan in Sweet Home 3D](https://aarongodfrey.dev/home%20automation/tips_for_creating_a_3d_floorplan_using_sweethome3d/)
- [Creating an Interactive 3D Floorplan in Home Assistant](https://aarongodfrey.dev/home%20automation/creating-a-3d-floorplan-in-home-assistant/)

### Bonus tip: HomeByMe

I've personally got recommended a tool for creating a 3D floorplan with a tool
that is generally lesser-known, but actually pretty awesome! [HomeByMe](https://home.by.me/en/)

<img src='/images/blog/2020-02-28-community-highlights/homebyme.png' alt='Screenshot of HomeByMe.' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>

This is a result of a 3D floorplan created with [HomeByMe](https://home.by.me/en/).

It works fully in the browser and I enjoyed the experience using that.
So credits where credits due: Thanks for recommending me this sweet little
gem [Andrea Donno](https://www.twitter.com/andreadonno)!
