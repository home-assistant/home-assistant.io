We’re delighted to announce that HomeWizard has joined the Works With Home Assistant program under the *‘Works Locally With Home Assistant’* badge and is committed to ensuring their products work well in Home Assistant. This Dutch company creates Wi-Fi devices that give households insight into their electricity, water, and gas consumption. They want to make people aware of their energy consumption and help them save on energy - not just because it’s good for their wallet, but also good for the world. A mission that matches our [Open Home values](/blog/2021/12/23/the-open-home/) perfectly. They will also be the first company to use our updated Works With Home Assistant badge, featuring the new Home Assistant logo!

HomeWizard’s journey to becoming a partner started with an engineer working on their energy meters, who developed a custom Home Assistant integration in his spare time. This custom integration grew and became part of Home Assistant core in release 2022.2, and its popularity with HomeWizard customers has led to HomeWizard adopting it and becoming an official partner today!

As a result, the [HomeWizard Energy integration](/integrations/homewizard/) has been developed by listening to the Home Assistant community. Features like a local API in their products and the ability to disable cloud communication were added in response. Currently, the integration supports the following products:

Wi-Fi P1 Meter (model: HWE-P1): Sensors for power import/export, energy consumption (single or three phases), information about your smart meter, and gas.

Wi-Fi Energy Socket (model: HWE-SKT): Sensors for power import/export, energy consumption, and switches for controlling the outlet.

Wi-Fi Watermeter (model: HWE-WTR): Sensors for active and total water usage.

Wi-Fi kWh Meter (models: SDM230-wifi, SDM630-wifi): Sensors for power import/export and energy consumption. 

While HomeWizard is a Dutch company, their products work in many countries. For example, the P1 Meter works on [most modern meters that have a P1 port](https://helpdesk.homewizard.com/en/articles/5935311-is-my-smart-meter-compatible), the Water meter on [analog water meters with Itron, Elster, or Sensus mounting holes](https://helpdesk.homewizard.com/en/articles/6287701-is-my-analog-watermeter-compatible), and the kWh Meters can be mounted on DIN rails. All of them can be purchased from [HomeWizard’s webshop](https://www.homewizard.com/shop/).

We’re very excited about this news, and we love the journey that the HomeWizard integration has taken from one engineer’s hobby to an official partnership.
