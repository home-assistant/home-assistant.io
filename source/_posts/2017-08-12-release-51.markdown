{% important %}
This release has to do a one time database migration which can take a long time on big databases (20 minutes). During this time the frontend will not work. Do not stop Home  Assistant while it is in progress.
{% endimportant %}

Release 0.51 is around the corner and it contains some really great updates.

## Database speed up

The first one is more amazing database updates [#8748] by [@OverloadUT]. Every query that has been tested executes in well under 1 second, even on a RPi using MySQL with 6 million rows and around 300 entities. This is true even when you're getting an unrealistically huge date range!

Updating the database will take some time when you start Home Assistant. During that time, the Home Assistant frontend is not accessible. Please let it complete and do not turn Home Assistant off.

## Frontend update

We have finished the migration of our frontend to be powered by Polymer 2. This has given us a big speed boost on Safari/iOS devices and has fixed a wide range of bugs.

We have also finished the automation editor. All triggers and actions are now implemented and so are most conditions (missing are `and`, `or`). The automation editor is also no longer Chrome only, it can now also be used in Safari.

Another change to the frontend is that we have reorganized the panels. The Z-Wave and automation configuration panels have been merged into the configuration panel.

## Vacuum cleaners

As we have seen more vacuum cleaners land in Home Assistant, it was time to create an official component for them. That's why [@azogue] introduced the new vacuum cleaner component in  [#8623]. This allows first class integration of vacuum cleaners in Home Assistant. Out of the box we will have Dyson, Xiamo and Roomba as supported platforms.
