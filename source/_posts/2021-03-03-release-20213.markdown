Home Assistant Core 2021.3! And my oh My Home Assistant!

I'm super excited for this release! 13 Brand new integrations! Z-Wave JS
is moving forward with an almost insane development speed; thank you all for
jumping into it as well! 🎉

For me, this release is about two things. My Home Assistant and some super slick
new UI features for everything related to service calls. What it is; is
explained down below, but both are just a leap forward in: making things easier.

My oh my, enjoy this release!

## My Home Assistant

Today we present you: <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io" class="my badge" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/homeassistant.svg"></a>

To be more helpful, we often want to link you to a specific page in your
Home Assistant instance. However, each Home Assistant instance is hosted at a
different URL. Yours might be `http://homeassistant.local:8123`, or something
completely different.

My Home Assistant allows the documentation, forums, chat, weblogs, or any
other website, to link you to specific pages in your Home Assistant instance,
without knowing the URL of your instance.

The beauty of this? All the data is stored locally in your browser
and My Home Assistant only redirects you to pages that provide you with
information about your instance or help you start an action.
Following a link from My Home Assistant will never make any changes
to your instance.

Long story short! We can do a lot of helpful things with this, for example, the
following buttons will bring your places on your instance:

{% my integrations badge %} {% my info badge %} {% my supervisor badge %} {% my automations badge %}

But we can make buttons or links to a lot of screen, and even help you start
a configuration for adding an integration, import a Blueprint, link to an
add-on page, and a lot more!

<img src='/images/blog/2021-03/mydemo.gif' alt='Screen recording showing how My Home Assistant works'>

</p>

Additionally, we have added a link/badge generator, so you can create your
own links, for e.g., adding to a Blueprint on the Blueprint Exchange.

<https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/>

Lastly, support for My Home Assistant with our apps is expected to be available
soon! Android should be available via an update today and iOS will land soon.

## New UI for service calls

This release adds a new user interface for doing service calls!

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2021-03/developer-services.png' alt='Screenshot of new call services in the Developer Tools'>
Screenshot of the new UI in the services tab of the Developer Tools.
</p>

The UI may look familiar, as it uses the same UI parts as used by the recently
introduced Blueprints. This new UI can be found in multiple places, that all
have adjusted with a shiny new UI;

- The {% my developer_services %} tab in the {% my developer_services title="Developer Tools" %}.
- Doing service calls in the {% my automations title="automation" %} UI editor.
- Doing service calls in the {% my scripts title="script" %} UI editor.
- In Lovelace cards that support calling actions.

Not all service calls will show this slick new UI yet, as the integrations
service descriptions need to be adjusted to with this. But, all common ones
have been migrated already. Like doing YAML? Well, the good old YAML mode is
available as well!

## Suggested areas

Areas are becoming more and more useful in Home Assistant, and this release
is helping out with putting them to use a bit!

Recently, it became possible to not only assign devices to areas, but entities
as well. And now; Integrations can now suggest areas!

This means, if an integration knows about an area/room/location place it is in,
it can suggest an area if the device isn't in one yet. For example, the Hue
integration can now suggest an area based on the Hue group it is in.

The following integration will now already suggest areas as of this release:

- [Bond][bond docs]
- [Hue][hue docs]
- [Hunter Douglas PowerView][hunterdouglas_powerview docs]
- [Lutron Caséta][lutron docs]
- [Netatmo][netatmo docs]
- [Nexia][nexia docs]
- [NuHeat][nuheat docs]
- [Roku][roku docs]
- [Sonos][sonos docs]
- [Tado][tado docs]
- [Universal Devices ISY994][isy994 docs]

## Fan speeds: 100%

Got an overhaul! Fans now work with speed percentages instead of the previous
"low", "mid", "high", "off". This makes Home Assistant more interoperable with
more fan brands and third-party assistants, like HomeKit.

Don't worry, everything has been implemented with backward compatibility.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2021-03/automation-editor.png' alt='Screenshot of automation editor, showing the % fan speeds!'>

</p>

Did you notice in the above screenshot, the automation editor is now wider?
The layout has been adjusted to give you more screen real estate when creating
automations.

## Z-Wave JS update

Also this release the Z-Wave JS team has been very busy. Several new features
have been added and many bugs squashed. Below you can read a summary.

We've introduced a protocol schema version in the Z-Wave JS server to allow
older clients to connect and talk to a newer server. This prevents compatibility
issues for the future!

Home Assistant Core 2021.3.0 will require Z-Wave JS server version 1.1.0.
If you're using the official Home Assistant add-on, the integration will
automatically update the add-on if an older add-on and server version is
encountered. Magic! If you're not using the Home Assistant add-on to run the
server you will need to update the server before updating Home Assistant Core.

You can now automate and change the configuration settings of your devices with
the [`zwave_js.set_config_parameter`](/integrations/zwave_js/#service-zwave_jsset_config_parameter)
service and create automations using the new [`zwave_js.refresh_value`](/integrations/zwave_js/#service-zwave_jsrefresh_value)
service, to update a device that doesn't automatically refresh itself.

But there is more!

- Garage doors (barrier) and similar covers can now be controlled.
- Some heating valves and similar devices that can be set to multiple different
  values will now show up as `number` entities.

## Flexible & variable automation triggers

We now support the use of variables and (limited) templates in automation
triggers! This can be really useful, for example, when making Blueprints for
MQTT based automations!

{% raw %}

```yaml
automation:
  trigger_variables:
    room: "living_room"
    node: "ac"
    value: "on"
  trigger:
    - platform: mqtt
      topic: "{{ room ~ '/switch/' ~ node}}"
      payload: "{{ 'state:' ~ value }}"
```

{% endraw %}

As shortly mentioned, the template syntax for trigger templates and variables
are more limited; read more about this in the
[limited templates](/docs/configuration/templating/#limited-templates)
documentation.

## Oversettelser i Supervisor panelet

Unless you are in the nordics, that title does not mean much, it's Norwegian and
translates to "Translations in the Supervisor panel". Yes! We have now added
translations in the Supervisor panel. 🎉

If you want to help translate that into your native language,
[join the frontend team on Localize](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/translations).

But we did not stop there! Now add-ons can provide
[translation files](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/configuration#add-on-translations)
for configuration options and network descriptions that
are shown in the frontend.

Not enough? You want more? Okay then!

- The communication between the frontend and the backend now relies on
  WebSockets, which allows the Supervisor to notify the frontend about changes.
- For add-on authors, you can now use YAML instead of JSON for your add-ons
  configuration files.
- New update dialog that will ask you to take a snapshot before you upgrade
  core/add-ons.
- Better hardware support to cover more devices.
- Passwords and secrets in add-on configurations are checked against known
  breaches with <https://haveibeenpwned.com/>

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- Shelly now supports battery-operated devices, thanks to [@thecode]!
- You can now use the color `homeassistant` as a `color_name` in your light
  service calls, just because we can 😎
- [@emontnemery], added support for using `alias` to virtually any step in
  scripts/automations. This is really helpful when debugging and documents
  your sequences as well, as it annotates each step.
- [@emontnemery] didn't stop there, he also added support for enabling/disabling
  integration configuration entries! So you can, e.g., temporarily disable a
  whole integration.

</p>

- Thanks to [@Nixon506E], you can now set a transition time when activate Hue
  scenes.
- In the {% my developer_states %} tab of the Developer Tools, there is now
  a small copy to clipboard button with each entity. Thanks, [@KTibow]!
- [@postlund] added support for repeat, shuffle and volume stepping to the
  media player integration of the Apple TV integration.
- [@larena1] reduced the amount of rendering history charts cause, so that
  will speed things up! Thanks!
- We now have a select selector! Great for adding dropdown choices
  to Blueprints, thanks [@EPMatt]!
- [@raman325] extended the Universal Media Player with a lot of new capabilities.
- When adding a new integration, the UI will now show discovered devices for
  that integration as well! Thanks, [@bramkragten]!
- We updated CodeMirror to the latest version, which provided the YAML code
  editors in our UI. It should now be better, faster and has improved support
  for mobile devices.

## Backward-incompatible changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Custom integrations: Version warning" %}

Custom integrations now require a `version` key in their manifest file, this
also means that all custom integrations now require a manifest file.

If you are using a legacy custom integration like `custom_components/awesome.py`
this now needs to move to `custom_components/awesome/__init__.py` so you can
add `custom_components/awesome/manifest.json` to it.

For more information about integration, manifests have a look here:
<https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_manifest>

**For now, this will create a warning on startup.** But this will eventually be
blocked from loading if it's missing a version in the manifest.

**If you see these warnings, please report the issue with the author
of that custom integration.**

([@ludeeus] - [#45919])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Fan" %}

The fan entity model has changed to split named speeds into percentages in the range
from 0 (off)-100 and preset modes.

**Why change?**

This change allowed us to expand the number of supported speeds to accommodate additional
fan models in Home Assistant.

We had 3 fan speeds and that worked great as long as the fan had no more than 3 speeds.

Over time we received a number of requests to add fans with 4, 5, or even more
speeds and preset modes. This put us in the difficult position of having to
reject this support because the underlying fan model didn’t support it.

Percentages were chosen because they can represent up to 100 speeds which should
accommodate all fans. Additionally, it’s a lot easier to ask your voice
assistant to set the fan to 20% then remember that medium-low is actually
low-medium or have to learn and remember how to say the speeds for every
fan model you want to control.

**What to change?**

Calls in automations and scripts to `fan.set_speed` should be replaced:

- Calls that set a speed should use `fan.set_percentage`.
- Calls that set a preset mode should use `fan.set_preset_mode`.

The following speeds existed in core integration and will now be automatically
identified as preset modes: `auto`, `smart`, `interval`, `idle`, and `favorite`.

Both of the new calls are backward compatible.

Calls in automations and scripts to `fan.turn_on` that use the `speed` attribute
should be switched to use the `percentage` or `preset_mode` attribute once the
underlying integration has been updated to support it.

All core fans have been updated to ensure that calls to the `fan.turn_on`
service map `percentage` or `preset_mode` to `speed` for backwards compatibility.

([@bdraco] - [#45407]) ([fan docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Template: Fan" %}

Template fans have been updated for the new entity model that uses a percentage
for the speed.

The following configuration options have been deprecated: `speed_template`, `set_speed`, and `speeds`.

The replacement options are `percentage_template` and `set_percentage`. There
is no replacement for `speeds` since the percentage is always from 1-100 along
with 0 for off.

([@bdraco] - [#45478]) ([template docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hyperion" %}

Hyperion has fully transitioned to configuration via UI. YAML configuration has
been removed. Existing YAML configuration has already been imported
automatically in the previous releases and can now safely be removed from your
configuration files.

([@dermotduffy] - [#45690]) ([hyperion docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nuki" %}

The Nuki integration is now configurable via the UI. The YAML configuration
is now deprecated.

You existing YAML configuration will be automatically imported on upgrade and
can be safely removed from your YAML configuration after upgrading.

([@pree] - [#45664]) ([nuki docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "CalDAV" %}

For CalDAV custom calendars, now only matching events are shown in the calendar
frontend, instead of all events for this calendar.

Although, this is technically a bugfix, if you didn't notice it before, it might
now surprise you.

([@inytar] - [#45701]) ([caldav docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Synology DSM" %}

All CPU-related sensors were named with "Load" which is not correct because
there is a difference between CPU load *average* and CPU utilization.

Units have been corrected.

Any automation that consumes this data may need to be updated.

([@mib1185] - [#45500])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LG Soundbar" %}

If `discovery` is used the entity will get a new `entity_id` derived from the
hostname of the soundbar. This means the `entity_id` can not be changed anymore
since there is currently no way to get a `unique_id` from the device.

([@bernimoses] - [#42044]) ([lg_soundbar docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MySensors" %}

MySensors has fully transitioned to configuration via UI. Existing YAML
configuration is automatically migrated and imported, and can now safely be
removed from your configuration files after upgrading.

No changes to YAML are applied after the migration has happened.
If you need to change anything, use the frontend.

([@functionpointer] - [#45421]) ([mysensors docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT: Covers" %}

MQTT cover `value_template` is deprecated to use for extracting position,
support will be removed in Home Assistant Core 2021.6.

Instead of using `value_template`, `position_template` should be used.

MQTT cover `tilt_invert_state` is deprecated, instead `tilt_min` and `tilt_max`
should be used. Support for `tilt_invert_state` will be removed in Home
Assistant Core 2021.6.

([@thecode] - [#46059]) ([mqtt docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Cameras and Streams" %}

Removes the internal `stream` components `record` service.

This service is meant to be used internally only by `camera` so this is not
expected to be a problem in practice as you should be using `camera.record`
instead.

([@allenporter] - [#45431]) ([camera docs]) ([generic docs]) ([nest docs]) ([stream docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HTTP: base_url" %}

The HTTP `base_url` URL setting was marked deprecated in Home Assistant Core
0.110 and replaced by the new internal & external URL settings that are
available in the UI.

This release removes the fallback logic to the old `base_url` setting. If you
still have an `base_url` configured in the HTTP section of your YAML
configuration, please remove it.

([@frenck] - [#46316])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT: Lights" %}

The MQTT light with template schema will now send a `float` instead of an `int`
with the transition key.

Lights that require an `int` instead of a `float` can restore the original
functionality by using the following in the template for specifying the
transition:

```txt
{{ transition|int }}
```

([@kangaroomadman] - [#46385]) ([mqtt docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Philips TV"%}

Configuration via YAML is now deprecated and you existing YAML configuration
will be automatically imported into the UI on first run. If your TV is not
running on first start, you will need to complete the configuration from
integration screen once your TV us online.

The previous `turn_on_action` will not be imported, and must be re-created as a
device trigger automation.

([@elupus] - [#45784]) ([philips_js docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ASUSWRT" %}

The legacy device tracker `DeviceScanner` was replaced with the new device
tracker implementation `ScannerEntity`.

You should remove references to platform `asuswrt` in `device_tracker` section
in your YAML configuration and update person device tracker with the new entity.

The YAML key `dnsmasq`, `interface` and `require_ip` now are managed as
integration options. The values present in YAML are imported in the options
the first time that the integration is loaded.

All sensors are initially created as disabled and can be enabled from ASUSWRT
device configuration instead of using YAML configuration.

([@ollo69] - [#46468]) ([asuswrt docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Keenetic NDMS2 Routers" %}

Keenetic NDMS2 Routers are now configured and managed from the UI. Existing
YAML configuration will be automatically imported and can be safely removed
after upgrading.

The upgraded platform also adds:

- Entities and devices manageable from UI.
- Binary sensors for router connection status.
- Support for monitoring multiple interfaces.

([@foxel] - [#38353]) ([keenetic_ndms2 docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Automations" %}

If an automation trigger template already renders as `true` on Home Assistant
Core startup, it will no longer trigger at startup. This bug fix prevents
unintended triggers of automations as startup, but might cause a different
behavior than before.

([@amelchio] - [#46423]) ([template docs])

Scripts and automations are now more careful about reporting problems with
conditions. For example, a `state` condition that references an unavailable
entity will log a message warning about the problem. Depending on the
circumstances when such errors happen, the flow of the automation
(i.e., stop/continue) might end up different from before.

([@amelchio] - [#46838]) ([automation docs]) ([homeassistant docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Xiaomi Miio" %}

Xiaomi Miio Switch, and Vacuum platforms should now be set up using the UI,
please remove the old YAML configuration from your configuration file.

They are now automatically discovered, if not, click Configuration in the
sidebar, then click Integrations and then click the + icon in the lower right
and find Xiaomi Miio.

Or click: {% my config_flow_start domain="xiaomi_miio" badge %}

Select the option “Connect to a Xiaomi Miio Device” and click submit,
follow the setup instructions.

([@starkillerOG] - [#46179] [#46669]) ([xiaomi_miio docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

HomeKit pairings and accessory IDs from Home Assistant Core version 0.109 and
earlier are no longer migrated on upgrade.

Users upgrading directly to 2021.3 from 0.109 and older should upgrade to
2021.2 first if they wish to preserve HomeKit configuration and avoid re-pairing
the bridge.

This change does not affect upgrades from 0.110 and later.

([@bdraco] - [#46616]) ([homekit docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Assistant" %}

Requests for closing/opening covers fully from Google Assistant will now use
`close`/`open` service instead of `set_postion` service. This a a revert of an
unexpected breaking change.

([@elupus] - [#46602]) ([google_assistant docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Habitica" %}

Habitica has fully transitioned to configuration via UI. Existing YAML
configuration is automatically migrated and imported, and can now safely be
removed from your configuration files after upgrading.

([@leikoilja] - [#38910]) ([habitica docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SSDP" %}

SSDP searches now binds to `0.0.0.0` instead of each interface separately.
Everything was still discovered in testing on a server with multiple interfaces.

([@bdraco] - [#46554]) ([ssdp docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave JS" %}

Minimum required zwave-js-server version is now 1.1.0.
You need to run this server version at mimimum for the integration to work.

([@marcelveldt] - [#46983]) ([zwave_js docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Bond" %}

Support for bond devices with up and down lights has been added. Previously,
if the device had two lights, only a single light entity would be created that
would not function properly. The functional light entity will need to be
manually removed.

([@bdraco] - [#46233]) ([bond docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "KNX" %}

Weather entity: Renamed `expose_sensors` to `create_sensors` to prevent
confusion with the KNX `expose_sensor` function.

([@farmio] - [#46809]) ([knx docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Honeywell Total Connect Alarm" %}

To support user equipment that requires the entry of a usercode in addition to
username and password, now all users must configure a usercode.

This can be done by updating the integration in the User Interface via
{% my integrations title="Configuration > Integrations" %}.

The use of YAML configuration is no longer supported.

([@austinmroczek] - [#39199]) ([totalconnect docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Tado" %}

Polling interval of 15 seconds causes high load on Tado servers and does not
provide enough value to warrant it. Tado plans to introduce a rate limit to
prevent such misuse of the API, therefore the polling interval needs to be
increased to make sure the integration works well in the future.

([@macrosak] - [#46915]) ([tado docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LiteJet" %}

LiteJet is now configured via the UI. Existing YAML configurations will
automatically be imported and can be removed after completing the upgrade.

LiteJet's `include_switches` YAML option has been removed. Switches can be
enabled via the integration's entity list in the UI.

LiteJet's `exclude_names` YAML option has been removed. Undesired entities can
be disabled via the integration's entity list in the UI.

([@joncar] - [#44409]) ([litejet docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nest" %}

The nest `FAN_ON` mode now sets the device timer to use the max duration of
12 hours, rather than the default of 15 minutes. If you would like the fan to
turn off sooner may use an automation with `timer` to set `FAN_OFF` sooner.

([@allenporter] - [#46489]) ([nest docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "credstash and keyring" %}

The methods of storing secrets in `credstash` and `keyring` have been removed.
They have been deprecated and a warning has been printed since
Home Assistant Core 2020.12.

([@balloob] - [#47033])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hue" %}

Hue groups are now disabled by default because they do not have a unique ID.
Existing configurations that have previously saved Hue options are not affected.

To enable Hue groups:

- Browse to your Home Assistant instance
- In the sidebar click on {% my configuration %}
- From the configuration menu select {% my integrations %}
- Find the entry for the Hue Bridge
- Select Options and change the setting

([@bdraco] - [#47067]) ([hue docs])

{% enddetails %}

## Farewell to the following

The following integrations are no longer available as of this release:

- **CoinMarketCap** has been removed, the used API has been out of service
    for a long time already. ([@frenck] - [#46615])

- **Synology** has been removed, the Synology DSM integration provides a full
  replacement. ([@thecode] - [#46482])
- **xFinity** Was previously marked deprecated. It relies on web scraping to
  function, which is no longer allowed.
  ([@thecode] - [#46484])
