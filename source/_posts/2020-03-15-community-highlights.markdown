Time for the fifth enactment of the Community Highlights!

We've received quite a few recommendations, but also closely monitored
social media and found some gems to share again!

## Controlling 7! marine aquariums with Home Assistant

Let's start with showcasing a highly unusual, but impressive, Home Assistant setup.
It is shared on our [Facebook group][facebook-group] by Kevin McPeake. Kevin's
setup has a total of 5 Home Assistant instances, controlling 7x marine aquariums!

Those are some big views Kevin! I bet you will be happy with the new Lovelace
features that are coming in Home Assistant Core 0.107. It will help
you to trim down that a bit, into multiple Lovelace Dashboards (now in
[beta, sneak peak?](/blog/2020/03/18/release-107/)).

## Live energy consumption screen

Energy saving is good for the environment (and your wallet). However, to do that,
you have to become aware of your actual usage. `/u/Lau-ie` shared his energy
consumption screen on our [subreddit][reddit].

This gives insight into the current usage, but also in the usage & costs of the
consumed energy of the last 24 hours.

Do you actively monitor your energy usage? What does your dashboard look like?

## A DIY smart magnetic key holder

And here is one from [James Callaghan](https://twitter.com/jamescallaghan), who
created really smart and easy to replicate magnet key holder, using a Xiaomi
Aqara Door/Window sensor. Yes, this key holder works on Zigbee.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mind goes crazy at the number of problems a single sensor can solve. For me, this was for reassurance using <a href="https://twitter.com/home_assistant?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@****home_assistant****</a> but when you think how this could be applied elsewhere concierge services to those with memory issues etc.. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/smarthome?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#smarthome</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inclusivity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#inclusivity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/accessibility?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#accessibility</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IoT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IoT</a> <a href="https://t.co/sirygbCE7p">pic.twitter.com/sirygbCE7p</a></p>&mdash; James Callaghan #Microsoft (@jamescallaghan) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamescallaghan/status/1237148097345654784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2020</a>
