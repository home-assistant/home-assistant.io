## Blueprint of the week
------

Imagine, you are listening to music and suddenly you get a call, then of course
you first want to turn the music down a bit to understand the person, what if
we automate that with a blueprint!

This week's blueprint is that of [JackPoint](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/JackPoint),
which will mute your media player when you receive a call and are at home. Try
it out! Read more about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or install
this automation in your instance with a click on the My button!

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://gist.github.com/JackPoint/2375dd5d15f0b4c52161207170c14f60" %}

Would you rather not have the media player muted but, for example, paused or take
another action? More variants can be found on the [Blueprint Exchange][blueprints]!

## Car Telemetry
------

A few editions earlier we had shown the dashboard of [Make_Itt_Work](https://www.reddit.com/user/Make_Itt_Work/)
and it contained telemetry data from his car. The question was of course how does
he do that?! Well, that question now has an answer, a video has come online with
all the details.

## Shower Duration

We've talked enough about saving energy, but using water efficiently is
just as important. With the [project](https://github.com/farstreet/shower)
from [farstreet](https://github.com/farstreet), which consists of some hardware
and an automation, you could time how long you are in the shower and indicate
with a LED light how long you have been under it.

Finished taking a shower? Then you can hear what your shower time was
through a media player.

## Mine Assistant
------

This item is especially nice for the Minecraft players, [Andy](https://gitlab.com/klikini)
has managed to switch a light in Home Assistant by means of a redstone block
in Minecraft! In the Reddit post you can find more information about this
project, as well code to get started yourself.
