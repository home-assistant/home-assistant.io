## Blueprint of the week
------

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://gist.github.com/Danielbook/7814e7eb32e880b2d7c3fb5ba8430f4f" %}

This week's blueprint is that of [danielbook](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/danielbook),
who created a blueprint that turns on the lights of a room based on a motion
and brightness sensor. You will no longer be in the dark when you get
home ðŸ˜‰ Try it out! Read more about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint]

Last time we shared a [dashboard with floorplan][floorplan], this time the
[floor3D card](https://github.com/adizanni/floor3d-card) from [adizanni](https://github.com/adizanni),
which you can use to get started with your own floorplan.

## Lovelace Dashboard
------

This week again we have a new Lovelace dashboard for the necessary portion
of inspiration ðŸ˜„ This time the one from [suckfail](https://www.reddit.com/user/suckfail/)
which has a [dashboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/nzn9u9/current_ha_dashboard_updated/)
with a variety of cards. If you want to know more about it, check out the
comment part on Reddit.

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center; margin-bottom:15px">
    <iframe id="reddit-embed" src="https://www.redditmedia.com/r/homeassistant/comments/nzn9u9/current_ha_dashboard_updated/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share&amp;embed=true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups" style="border: none;" height="528" width="640" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Would you also like your dashboard to be in the community highlight? Drop it
on [Reddit][reddit] and maybe I'll pick it out for the next edition.
