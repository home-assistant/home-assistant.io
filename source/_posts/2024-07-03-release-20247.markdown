Home Assistant 2024.7! üéâ

Get ready for a really nice release with something interesting for everyone! ü§ó

And not just that, I bring you these release notes from our refreshed website ü§©
that [Madelena] and [yours truly] have been spontaneously working on over the
past few days. We hope you like it! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Some fantastic additions to [Assist](/voice_control): Timers!
and the ability to expose your scripts to LLMs. In case you missed it,
it has been covered and demonstrated live in our recent
[Voice - Chapter 7 livestream!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLO4u2Tbbo)
which you definitely should watch. üì∫

The¬†[sections view](/dashboards/sections/)¬†becomes more feature-rich with
every release, and this time, the [ability to¬†resize cards](#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard)
is added. Absolutely the highlight of the release for me!

My second favorite highlight for this release is the ability to
[take control of blueprint-based automations](#take-control-of-blueprint-based-automations).
There are so many¬†[amazing blueprints out there](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange/53/l/top?period=yearly),
and many are perfect, but sometimes they fit 90% of what you need. Being able
to take control of that last 10% is just amazing!

Enjoy the release!

## Resize the cards on your dashboard 

As [part of our roadmap](/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards), we're
continuing to make dashboard organization and customization easier and more
intuitive. This month, we add the ability to [resize the cards] on your
dashboard!

<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/dashboard-resize-cards-example.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing several cards at different sizes.'>

Resizing is done with a very nice slider interface, found in the card editing
menu under the new **Layout** tab, where you can preview your changes. Make
small 1x1 buttons or give a [map] the space it needs. This is only available on
our experimental [sections view], which was recently released with drag-and-drop.

<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/dashboard-resize-card.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing the card edit diaglog, with the new layout tag and its card resize capabilities.'>

It works with [every card], which gives users a lot of freedom. Most cards have
been given a built-in minimum and maximum size, to make it easier to get your
layouts just right. If you mess up the look of a card, luckily we have included
a revert button {% icon "mdi:restore" %} in the
top left corner üòâ.

## Data tables improvements

Like the¬†[last release] and [release before that], we keep improving our data
tables. We use data tables to organize information in our settings pages,
including our devices and automations pages.

With this release, we add the final big piece of the puzzle: The ability to
customize the columns shown! üòé

<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/data-tables-customize-columns.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing the dialog that allow customizing the order and visibility of data table columns available on the device page.'>

By selecting the cog {% icon "mdi:cog" %} in
the top right, you can not only customize the columns shown by toggling
visibility {% icon "mdi:eye" %}, but you
can also change the order of the columns by
dragging {% icon "mdi:drag" %} them around.
Making it even easier to show the data you want, in the order you want it.

Your customized columns and view are stored in your browser, so you only have 
to set them up once. They will be remembered the next time you visit the page.

## Voice & Assist

This month, we're thrilled to bring more enhancements to [Assist's] out-of-the-box
capabilities. We've added support for timers ‚è≤Ô∏è ‚Äî our third most requested
feature for voice control ‚Äî and the powerful ability to expose your
{% term scripts %} to LLMs (like [ChatGPT] and [Google Gemini]) as well! üí™

If you missed it, be sure to check out our recent Voice - Chapter 7 livestream
from June 26th, where we showcased all these exciting developments. You can
[read more in our blog post here] and [watch the full livestream on YouTube]. üéôÔ∏è

### Timers are here!

You asked, and we listened! As of this release, timers are available. This
feature allows you to create, cancel, pause, resume, and adjust timers using
your voice, making everyday tasks like cooking much easier. And yes, you can
set multiple timers at once! üéâ

[Read more about timers in the Chapter 7 blog post](/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#timers-are-here).

{% note %}
Timers are available today on [ESPHome] and [Wyoming voice satellites].
To take advantage of this new feature, update these devices to the latest
version.
{% endnote %}

### Expand an LLM using your scripts

You can now expand LLM capabilities by allowing them access to (your choice)
of your {% term scripts %}. This feature lets you precisely control what the
LLM does in specific situations, while still benefiting from the flexibility
and natural language processing that AIs excel at.

For example, you can create a _"leaving home"_ script that performs the actions
you want and [expose it to Assist]. This ensures that commands like
_"I'm heading out for a couple of minutes"_ will run your predefined script,
such as locking the door without turning off the air conditioning.

[Read more about expanding LLMs with script in the Chapter 7 blog post](/blog/2024/06/26/voice-chapter-7/#expand-an-llm-with-scripts).

[expose it to Assist]: /voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/

## Take control of blueprint-based automations

{% term Blueprints %} are amazing; they allow you to use {% term automations %}
and {% term scripts %} created and shared by other awesome Home Assistant users.
Most are easy to use and set up, but what if that great blueprint you've been
using just needs a little tweak? Just that tiny change to make it perfect for
your home?

Well, now you can! üéâ

<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/blueprint-automation-take-control.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing a blueprint-based automation that can be taken of using the "Take control" option in the three-dotted menu.'>

You can now [take full control over the automations created from a blueprint](/docs/automation/using_blueprints/#editing-an-imported-blueprint).
By taking control {% icon "mdi:file-edit" %},
Home Assistant will convert the blueprint automation into a regular,
stand-alone, automation. This allows you to make any tweak you want,
without having to re-invent the wheel.

<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/blueprint-automation-preview.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing a preview of how a converted blueprint automation would look like before you take control.'>

The cool thing is that it shows you a preview of how the converted automation
would look like before you take over. This way, you can see what you are getting
into before you actually do it.

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Feedreader]**, done by [@mib1185]
- **[Generic Hygrostat]**, done by [@elupus]
- **[Generic Thermostat]**, done by [@elupus]
- **[Intergas InComfort/Intouch Lan2RF gateway]**, done by [@jbouwh]

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are no longer available as
of this release:

- **Aladdin Connect** has been removed, as Home Assistant cannot use the
  upstream library at this time.
- **Unify Circuit** was deprecated in Home Assistant 2024.5 and has now been
  removed.

## ESPHome update entities for ready-made projects

Our sister project, [ESPHome] received a brand new logo this month! üéâ

<img style='border: 0;box-shadow: none; padding-bottom: 16px' src='https://esphome.io/_static/logo-text-on-light.svg' alt='Logo of ESPHome'>

Looks familiar, right? üòÉ That is because ESPHome has [been donated] to the
[Open Home Foundation] by [Nabu Casa]. The same foundation that the Home
Assistant project is part of.

Besides the new logo, ESPHome has added a new feature that works with this
release of Home Assistant: The ability for makers of
[ready-made devices or projects] running on ESPHome, to [provide updates]
for their devices directly to Home Assistant.

This means that if you have a device that is powered-by or [Made for ESPHome],
and the maker of that device provides updates for it, you can now update that
device directly from Home Assistant; without the need for you to build, adopt,
or set up the ESPHome software yourself! üòé

These two new features&mdash;updating from Home Assistant, and the ESPHome
integration reaching the platinum quality level üèÜ&mdash;make it easier for new
users and creators to use this powerful platform to build a more Open Home.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- It is now actually possible to change the username of your Home Assistant
  account, thanks [@edenhaus] & [@bramkragten]!
- Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if an automation can't be set up
  (for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks [@emontnemery]!
- We now show additional entity categories on the device page, grouping
  [notification] entities in a "Notification" category. Furthermore, all
  [Assist]-related entities, like [conversation agents and text-to-speech]
  entities, are now grouped in an "Assist" category. Thanks [@balloob]!
- [Assist] now has _"Previous"_ media player intent, adding to the list
  of new intents we [added last release]. Nice [@OzGav]!
- [Trend helpers] are now automatically linked to the same device as the source
  entity they are based on. Thanks [@dougiteixeira]!
- The [generic thermostat] and [generic hygrostat] are now available via the
  UI, allowing you to create a thermostat or hygrostat based on existing
  switches and sensors. Thanks [@elupus]!

### Link your template entity to an existing device

[Template entities] are an advanced and powerful way to create your own
{% term entities %} in Home Assistant based on any calculation or logic you
can imagine.

One of the [most requested features] for {% term template %} entities is the
ability to assign and link them to an existing {% term device %}. Thanks
to [@dougiteixeira], you can now do just that! üéâ

<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/templates-link-to-device.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt='Screenshot showing you can select a device the template can be linked to, when adding a new template helper.'>

Assigning a template entity to an existing device can be very useful if you have
a template that calculates an additional sensor value for a device. For example,
in the screenshot above, a template helper calculates the sum of two sensors
and is linked to the device that has those sensors.

{% note %}
This feature is only available for template entities that are created
from the UI.
{% endnote %}

[Template entities]: /integrations/template
[@dougiteixeira]: https://github.com/dougiteixeira
[most requested features]: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/why-cant-we-add-template-entities-to-existing-devices/467149

### Change the radius of your home zone

{% term Zones %} in Home Assistant are a great way to define locations on your
map, such as your work, and trigger automations based on your location. The most
powerful zone is undoubtedly the home zone, which you can use to determine
if someone is home, coming home, or leaving.

Until now, the radius of the home zone was fixed at 100 meters, which was not
always ideal for everyone. Although it could be changed using YAML, as of this
release, you can now change the radius of your home zone directly from the
Home Assistant user interface!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/docs/configuration/change_location_radius.webp' alt='Screenrecording of how you can now change the radius of the home zone.'><br/>

{% important %}
If you have currently configured and overridden your home zone using YAML
configuration, this new feature will not be available to you. You can remove
the YAML configuration and restart Home Assistant to enable UI control.
{% endimportant %}

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Authentication" %}

The legacy API password (`legacy_api_password`) authentication provider that
was deprecated in Home Assistant 2023.12, has been removed.

([@edenhaus] - [#119976]) ([documentation](/integrations/auth))

[@edenhaus]: https://github.com/edenhaus
[#119976]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119976

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Azure DevOps" %}

All attributes of the "latest build" sensor are now deprecated; each now has
a dedicated sensor entity available. If you use these attributes in your
automations or scripts, you need to adjust these to use one of the
new sensors instead.

([@timmo001] - [#114948]) ([documentation](/integrations/azure_devops))

[@timmo001]: https://github.com/timmo001
[#114948]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/114948

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Blink" %}

The previously deprecated Blink update service has now been removed.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#119919]) ([documentation](/integrations/blink))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#119919]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119919

{% enddetails %}

{% details "BMW Connected Drive" %}

The charging mode and charging status sensors have been updated to use lowercase
state values. If you use these sensors in your automations or scripts,

{% details "La Marzocco" %}

On March 19th, 2024, La Marzocco released a machine firmware update, v3.5-rc5,
together with a new version of the La Marzocco Home App.
 
Once the app update is installed, the previous scheduling functionality is
removed from the app, and a new scheduling mode is shown. This mode is disabled
until the machine's firmware has also been updated.

Similarly, if the machine's firmware is updated before the app, the previous
scheduling functionality does not work.

The previous calendar and auto on/off switches are replaced with calendars
and switches per schedule.
