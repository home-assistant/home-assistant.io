{% note %}

**Welcome to the beta release notes for Home Assistant 2024.7** üéâ

<br />

Please note that these release notes are a work in progress. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We will be
completing them over the next couple of days. Not all features might be final
yet, and some features _**may not** make it into the final release_.

<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.
You can find our issue trackers and the reported issues during beta here:

<br />

- [Report(ed) beta **dashboards/UI/frontend** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/milestone/121)
- [Report(ed) beta **integrations/automations/backend/core** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/milestone/677)
- [Report(ed) beta **documentation** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/milestone/128)

üôè When reporting issues, **make sure to mention the exact beta version you are
running** in the issue description. This will help us identify and track the
issue correctly. Read more about [reporting issues here](/help/reporting_issues/).

<br />

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority. üîù

## Resize the cards on your Dashboard 

As [part of our roadmap](/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards), we're
continuing to make dashboard organization and customization easier
and more intuitive. This month, we add the ability to resize the cards on
your dashboard!

<p class='img'>
    <img src="https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/1ed75c96-6db5-4d4a-ae61-e454791d7fd1" alt="Screenshot of..."/>
    Temporary screenshot, image needs to be replaced.
</p>

Resizing is done with a very nice slider interface, found in the card editing menu under the new _Layout_ tab, where you can preview your changes. Make small 1x1 buttons or give a map the space it needs. This is only available on our experimental [sections view]([url](/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#a-new-experimental-sections-view)), which was recently released with drag-and-drop. 

<img src='/images/blog/2024-07/resize-cards.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>

It works with every card, which gives users a lot of freedom. Most cards have been given a built-in minimum and maximum size, to make it easier to get your layouts just right.  If you mess up the look of a card, luckily we have included a revert button in the top left corner üòâ.

## Data tables improvements

Like the [last release](/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#data-tables-improvements),
and the [release before that](/blog/2024/05/01/release-20245/#more-features-for-our-data-tables),
we keep improving our data tables. Data tables are how we organize information in our settings pages, including our devices and automations pages.

With this release, we add the final big piece of the puzzle: The ability to
customize the columns shown! üòé

<p class='img'>
    <img src="https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5662298/d968b845-c327-41d1-9240-ddf393088277" alt="Screenshot of..."/>
    Temporary screenshot, image needs to be replaced.
</p>

Not only can you now customize the columns shown, but you can also change the
order of the columns by dragging them around. Making it even easier to show the
data you want, in the order you want it.

Your customized columns and view are stored in your browser, so you only have to
set it up once, and it will be remembered the next time you visit the page.

## Take control of blueprint-based automations or scripts

{% term Blueprints %} are amazing; they allow you to use {% term automations %}
and {% term scripts %} created and shared by other awesome Home Assistant users.
Most are easy to use and set up, but what if that great blueprint you've been
using just needs a little tweak? Just that tiny change to make it perfect for
your home?

Well, now you can! üéâ

<p class='img'>
    <img src="https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/94870e02-d426-439f-bad7-fb72ba758e95" alt="Screenshot of..."/>
    Temporary screenshot, image needs to be replaced by an actual screenshot.
</p>

You can now take full control over the automations created from a blueprint.
By taking control, Home Assistant will fully convert the blueprint automation
into a regular, stand-alone automation. This allows you to make any tweak you
want, without having to fully re-invent the wheel.

<lite-youtube videoid="gSm9I4Ru2bs" videotitle="Temporary screenrecording"></lite-youtube>

Looking for some inspiration for your next automation? üí° Check out the
[Blueprint exchange on the Home Assistant Community Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange/53/l/top?period=yearly).

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **Unify Circuit** was deprecated in Home Assistant 2024.5 and has now been
  removed.

## ESPHome update entities for ready-made projects

Our sister project, [ESPHome] received a brand new logo this month! üéâ

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://esphome.io/_static/logo-text-on-light.svg' alt='Logo of ESPHome'>

<br /><br />

Looks familiar, right? üòÉ That is because ESPHome has [been donated] to the
[Open Home Foundation] by [Nabu Casa]. The same foundation that the Home
Assistant project is part of.

Besides the new logo, ESPHome has added a new feature that works with this release of Home Assistant: The ability for makers of
[ready-made devices, or projects] running on ESPHome, to [provide updates]
for their devices directly to Home Assistant.

This means that if you have a device that is powered-by or [Made for ESPHome],
and the maker of that device provides updates for it, you can now update that
device directly from Home Assistant; without the need for you to build, adopt,
or set up the the ESPHome software yourself! üòé

This new update ability, along with the ESPHome integration reaching the platinum quality level üèÜ, will make it easier for new users, along with creators to use this powerful platform to build a more Open Home.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- It is now actually possible to change the username of your Home Assistant
  account, thanks [@edenhaus] & [@bramkragten]!
- Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if an automation can't be set up
  (for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks [@emontnemery]!
- We now show additional entity categories on the device page, grouping
  [notification] entities in a "Notification" category. Furthermore, all
  [Assist] related entities, like [conversation agents and text-to-speech]
  entities, are now grouped in an "Assist" category. Thanks [@balloob]!
- [Trend helpers] are now automatically linked to the same device as the source
  entity it is based on. Thanks [@dougiteixeira]!
- The [generic thermostat] and [generic hygrostat] are now available via the
  UI, allowing you to create a thermostat or hygrostat based on existing
  switches and sensors. Thanks [@elupus]!

[Trend helpers]: /integrations/trend

### Link your template entity to an existing device

[Template entities] are an advanced and powerful way to create your own
{% term entities %} in Home Assistant based on any calculation or logic you
can imagine.

One of the [most requested features] for {% term template %} entities is the
ability to assign and link them to an existing {% term device %}. Thanks
to [@dougiteixeira], you can now do just that! üéâ

_TODO: insert screenshot_

Assigning a template entity to an existing device can be very useful if you have
a template that calculates an additional sensor value for a device.

_Note: This feature is only available for template entities that are created
from the UI._

[Template entities]: /integrations/template
[@dougiteixeira]: https://github.com/dougiteixeira
[most requested features]: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/why-cant-we-add-template-entities-to-existing-devices/467149

### Change the radius of your home zone

{% term Zones %} in Home Assistant are a great way to define locations on your
map, such as your work, and trigger automations based on your location. The most
powerful zone is undoubtedly the home zone, which you can use to determine
if someone is home, coming home, or leaving.

Until now, the radius of the home zone was fixed at 100 meters, which was not
always ideal for everyone. Although it could be changed using YAML, as of this
release, you can now change the radius of your home zone directly from the
Home Assistant user interface!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/docs/configuration/change_location_radius.webp' alt='Screenrecording of how you can now change the radius of the home zone.'>

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Authentication" %}

The in Home Assistant 2023.12 deprecated legacy API password
(`legacy_api_password`) authentication provider has been removed.

([@edenhaus] - [#119976]) ([documentation](/integrations/auth))

[@edenhaus]: https://github.com/edenhaus
[#119976]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119976

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Azure DevOps" %}

All attributes of the "latest build" sensor are now deprecated; each now has
a dedicated sensor entity available. If you use these attributes in your
automations or scripts, you need to adjust these to use one of the
new sensors instead.

([@timmo001] - [#114948]) ([documentation](/integrations/azure_devops))

[@timmo001]: https://github.com/timmo001
[#114948]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/114948

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Blink" %}

The previously deprecated Blink update service has now been removed.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#119919]) ([documentation](/integrations/blink))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#119919]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119919

{% enddetails %}

{% details "BMW Connected Drive" %}

The charging mode and charging status sensors have been updated to use lowercase
state values. If you use these sensors in your automations or scripts,
you must update them to use the new lowercase values.

([@rikroe] - [#118751]) ([documentation](/integrations/bmw_connected_drive))

[@rikroe]: https://github.com/rikroe
[#118751]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/118751

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Calendar" %}

Calendar service `list_events` was deprecated in favor of `get_events` in 
Home Assistant 2023.12 and has now been removed.

Use the new `get_events` service to retrieve events from `calendar` entities
instead.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#118663]) ([documentation](/integrations/calendar))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#118663]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/118663

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ComEd Hourly Pricing" %}

The unit of measurement for the ComEd Hourly Pricing integration has been
corrected from `c` to `¬¢/kWh`.

([@themaxgross] - [#115594]) ([documentation](/integrations/comed_hourly_pricing))

[@themaxgross]: https://github.com/themaxgross
[#115594]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/115594

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DNS IP" %}

The attribute names `Resolver` and `Querytype` have been renamed to
`resolver` and `querytype`. If ause these in any automation or script,
you need to update them to use the new lowercase names.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#119727]) ([documentation](/integrations/dnsip))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#119727]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119727

---

The attributes `resolver`, `querytype`, and `ip_addresses` for the DNS IP
sensor are excluded from the recorder and no longer stored in history.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#119726]) ([documentation](/integrations/dnsip))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#119726]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119726

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Fast.com" %}

The previously deprecated `speedtest` service from `fastdotcom` has been removed.
Use the [`homeassistant.update_entity` service](/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval)
to refresh and run a speedtest manually instead.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#119780]) ([documentation](/integrations/fastdotcom))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#119780]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119780

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Intergas InComfort/Intouch Lan2RF gateway" %}

Based on the boiler display code or fault code, the boiler status
has been refactored to be signified and unique, so we can start supporting
localization.

Depending on the old status texts, automations or scripts might break.
You need to ensure your automations and scripts are updated to use the new
status values.

The new display codes are:

-	0: `opentherm`
-	15: `boiler_ext`
-	24: `frost`
-	37: `central_heating_rf`
-	51: `tapwater_int`
-	85: `sensortest`
-	102: `central_heating`
-	126: `standby`
-	153: `postrun_boiler`
-	170: `service`
-	204: `tapwater`
-	231: `postrun_ch`
-	240: `boiler_int`
-	255: `buffer`

The new fault codes are:

- 0: `sensor_fault_after_self_check`
- 1: `cv_temperature_too_high`
- 2: `s1_and_s2_interchanged`
- 4: `no_flame_signal`
- 5: `poor_flame_signal`
- 6: `flame_detection_fault`
- 8: `incorrect_fan_speed`
- 10: `sensor_fault_s1`
- 11: `sensor_fault_s1`
- 12: `sensor_fault_s1`
- 13: `sensor_fault_s1`
- 14: `sensor_fault_s1`
- 20: `sensor_fault_s2`
- 21: `sensor_fault_s2`
- 22: `sensor_fault_s2`
- 23: `sensor_fault_s2`
- 24: `sensor_fault_s2`
- 27: `shortcut_outside_sensor_temperature`
- 29: `gas_valve_relay_faulty`
- 30: `gas_valve_relay_faulty`

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#119207]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/119207

{% enddetails %}

{% details "La Marzocco" %}

On March 19th, 2024, La Marzocco released a machine firmware update, v3.5-rc5,
together with a new version of the La Marzocco Home App.
 
Once the app update is installed, the previous scheduling functionality is
removed from the app, and a new scheduling mode is shown. This mode is disabled
until the machine's firmware has also been updated.

Similarly, if the machine's firmware is updated before the app, the previous
scheduling functionality does not work.

The previous calendar and auto on/off switches are replaced with calendars
and switches per schedule.

from where they come).
