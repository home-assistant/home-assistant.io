## Dipping our toes in the world of AI using LLMs

Our voice assistant brain is called a **conversation agent**.
It is responsible for understanding the intention behind the spoken command,
performing an action, and generating a response.

Since the beginning of our voice journey, we allowed you to switch your
conversation agent for an LLM-based one. This led to some very funny experiments,
such as our [infamous interview with Mario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLx8_NAqptk).

Up until now, these two worlds (our own Home Assistant conversation agent
controlling your home, LLM-based conversation agents) were not overlapping,
it was impossible to control your home from a LLM-based conversation agent.

Today we're happy to announce that we are closing this gap!

<lite-youtube videoid="3V9Pj6XCels" videotitle="Temporary video that needs to be replaced"></lite-youtube>

When setting up an LLM-Based conversation agent you can decide to let your
conversation agent control your home with a flick of a switch.

    Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

This release makes this available to [OpenAI](/components/openai_conversation/) and [Google AI](/components/google_generative_ai_conversation/). To make it easier to get started with LLMs, we have updated these integrations with recommended model settings that strike the right balance between accuracy, speed and cost. If you had them set up previously, we recommend enabling the recommended settings and emptying the instructions.

Our recommended model settings perform equally well for voice assistant tasks. Google is 14x cheaper than OpenAI, but OpenAI is better at answering non-smart home questions. We are preparing a blog post with a deep dive into the research that went into this feature, coming soon.

_Thanks to our AI team [@shulyaka](https://github.com/shulyaka), [@tronikos](https://github.com/tronikos), [@allenporter](https://github.com/allenporter), [@synesthesiam](https://github.com/synesthesiam), [@jlpuffier](https://github.com/jlpuffier) and [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob) for this feature!_


## Assist: Media player intents

We released new voice intents in 2024.3: The ability to control media players

- Pausing playback
- Resuming Playback
- Setting the volume of a media player
- Playing the next media in the queue

Up until now, we were only proposing sentence targeting a specific entity by its
name. Due to this limitation, these intents were not the most user friendly to
use, as the sentences were pretty heavy to say: _"Skip to the next song on the TV"_.

We are now proposing sentences targeting an area, Home Assistant will handle all
the logic of deciding which exposed media player to target based on the intents
triggered.

We paired these new sentences with our "Context awareness" feature _(The ability
to implicitly target the same area in which the voice assistant is)_.

Thanks to that, we are now able to provide very simple and user friendly
sentences to control your media players, such as:

- Pause
- Resume
- Next
- Set the volume to 50%

<lite-youtube videoid="SAd5ZBOhaUg" videotitle="Temporary video that needs to be replaced"></lite-youtube>

Just make sure your voice assistant is assigned to an area that contains an
exposed media player, and you will be good to go.

## Show sections conditionally

For the new sections dashboard feature, we added a new visibility option. This
options allows you to hide or show a section based on certain conditions.

For example, you may want to only display a section on mobile, when you're at
home, and when the kitchen lights are on.

It uses the [same conditions as condition cards](/dashboards/conditional/#conditions-options).
The big difference is, that you don't need a condition card to use this feature.
it is available directly in the section configuration, in the visibility tab
in the options of a section.

<lite-youtube videoid="hhELdXsyL9Q" videotitle="Temporary video that needs to be replaced"></lite-youtube>

## Setting a dashboard background

[@Nezz] contributed an great new feature to our dashboarding UI: The ability to
set an background image for your dashboard!

Previously, this was only possible by editting YAML, but now you can do it
directly from the UI. Even better, you can just directly upload an image from
your computer!

![Screenshot 2024-05-02 231131](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/431167/706dc550-1335-46ee-9673-6fced559c533)

This same ability to upload images directly from your computer, was added
to the picture card too! Thanks, [@karwosts] for that one!

_Note: Add a picture uploader to picture-card-editor (#18695) @karwosts__

## Data tables improvements

Just like the last release, this release keeps on improving our data tables.

When we introduced grouping of data in the tables, you've been asking for a way
to collapse and expand those groupings, so, last release, we did! But then
quickly realized that it was not enough, and you wanted to be able to collapse
and expand all groups at once. So, we did that for this release!

![CleanShot 2024-05-28 at 11 07 39@2x](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5662298/ff5645b1-18c0-4a7d-8b09-3e15ffa9cc0d)

Additionally, filters you've set in the data tables are now saved in your
browser session. Meaning, if you navigate away from the page and come back, your
filters will still be there. But! Each browser tab or window has its own session,
meaning you can have different filters in different tabs or windows that are
remembered for that specific tab or window.

Lastly, we've expanded the voice assistant expose data table to allow grouping
by area and domain.

![CleanShot 2024-05-15 at 10 51 08](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/1603f219-8828-47f5-a4a7-603111f64f97)

## Updates Matter

First of all, as one of the first in the industry, we are proud to announce that
Home Assistant is already based on the latest Matter specification: Matter 1.3!

Improved logic for custom clusters which allows us to receive custom attributes
push based (attribute subscrtiption) if the device supports that and if not,
we receive it using a poll logic. This Poll logic has also been optimized and
now is executed in an optimized way server-side, accounting for network traffic
so it will no longer have a very bad negative impact on bigger Thread networks.

Introduction of the Fan platform, used by Air Purifier and Room Airconditioner
device types in Matter.

Lots of smaller bugfixes and extensions of discovery schemas so more entities
will be discovered for your Matter devices. Also, optimizations of the climate
platform to fix issues with setting a new thermostat setpoint, for example,
on various devices.

## Ability to disable the expiring of login tokens

A few releases ago we introduce the automatic expiration of logins. If a login
token wasn't used for 90 days, it would expire and automatically be cleaned up.

Some users have expressed that they would like to disable this feature, so we
added a new option to the user profile settings to disable the expiration of
login tokens.

![CleanShot 2024-05-27 at 16 49 35](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/fab560e1-28fc-4ad7-bbbf-cd65607a8ae2)

## Tag entities!

Home Assistant has support for tags for a long time. The tags feature allowed
for NFC tags or QR codes, to be used with Home Assistant, for example, to
trigger automations.

However, tags were not real entities, and thus not always as logical to use as
other entities. With this release, this has been changed by [@gjohansson-ST]!

Tags are now normal entities, and can be used in automations, scripts, templates,
and even been shown on your dashboard!

## Collapsable sections for blueprints!

[@karwosts] added the ability to add collapsible sections to blueprint
configuration. This allows blueprint creators to group configuration options
together, or to hide advanced or less common options by default.

![collapsible-blueprint](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/assets/32912880/8a05f428-d4cc-41ef-9507-764d191f197b)

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- A default code can now be set in the entity settings for every alarm control
  panel entities. Nice work [@gjohansson-ST]!
- [@Troon] added a filter to our templates: `add`. This filter allows you to
  add a value, similar to the existing `multiply`. Great!
- A new action building block has been added to our automations and scripts
  by [@frenck]: [Run sequence of actions]. This allows you to group multiple
  actions together.
- Need a wireless device that can bridge a larger distance? A [LoRa] device
  might be a good option. Thanks to [@angelnu] we now have a working integration
  for [The Things Network].
- [@starkillerOG] added support for PIR and battery sensors to the [Reolink]
  integrations. Nice!
- The [Teslemetry] integration has been expanded tremendously, adding new
  platforms and features. Awesome job [@Bre77]!
- Limited templates can now be used to disable triggers, conditions and actions.
  [@farmio] thought this might be helpful for blueprint creators.

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Anova" %}

The `State` and `Mode` entities for Anova devices have been changed to match the
new protocol messaging. Any automations based on these entities will need to be
updated.

[@Lash-L]: https://github.com/Lash-L
[#109508]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109508

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!Box Tools" %}

The previously deprecated services `reboot`, `reconnect` and `cleanup` has been
removed. Please use the corresponding button entities instead.

[#118108]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/118108

{% enddetails %}

{% details "File" %}

The notify services for the file integration now require that the file path
is an allowed path. You should check the accessed file is in the
[allowlist_external_dirs](/integrations/homeassistant/#allowlist_external_dirs)
to ensure your automation's keep working.

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#116861]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116861

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT Lock now supports the lock `open` and `opening` state. When a lock is used
in `optimistic` mode. The the lock's state will become `open` instead
of `unlocked` when an MQTT Lock is opened.

([@jbouwh] - [#117110]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#117110]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117110

---

The behavior on processing  empty and `"None"` state payloads for MQTT entities
has been made more predictable for `alarm_control_panel`, `climate`, `cover`,
`device_tracker`, `lock`, `select`, `valve` and `water_heater` items:

- A "None" (string) for a state payload generally means that the state
  becomes `unknown`.
- An empty payload is ignored.

Previously, a "None" state could be considered invalid or was just ignored.

{% details "OpenWeatherMap" %}

Migration to new library with support of OneCall API (3.0).

OWM API v2.5 will be closed in June 2024. All OpenWeatherMap integrations must
be migrated to mode (API) v3.0 to avoid service interruption.

Before the migration, you must have an active subscription (be aware that
subscription activation takes up to 2h). After the subscription is activated,
users can migrate integrations to mode v3.0 via repair notification or manually
via the integration configuration menu.

The subscription has a free tier with 1000 calls/day. Consider setting the limit
on the OpenWeatherMap website to stay under the threshold where API usage
incurs a cost.
