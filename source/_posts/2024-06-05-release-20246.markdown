Home Assistant Core 2024.6! üéâ

Welcome to another loaded release of Home Assistant! Packed with many exciting
new features, this month is most definitely one to remember.

Let's talk about AI. AI might just as well be the talk of the century. These
so-called [LLMs] most certainly open up a whole new world of possibilities.
When we first introduced the OpenAI and Google AI conversation agents for Assist,
one of the most requested features was the ability to control your home with it.

Now for the big news:

_**Well, as of today, you can control your home with an AI!**_ ü§ñ

But there is a lot more to this release. Super simple media player commands,
more data table improvements, tag entities, collapsible blueprint sections,
and so much more!

I‚Äôm personally most excited about the new features in the dashboarding area.
Being able to conditionally show sections and cards is definitely a game-changer
for my dashboards.

Enjoy the release!

## Voice & Assist

This month, we are continuing our work on improving Assist's out-of-the-box
capabilities: Not only are we adding features that you would expect from a
voice assistant, such as media control, but we are leap-frogging ahead with
some new exciting developments and experimenting with AI! ü§ñ

We will have more to announce during a soon-to-be-announced _Voice - Chapter 7_
livestream on June the 26th! Keep an eye out for that! üéôÔ∏è

### Dipping our toes in the world of AI using LLMs

Our voice assistant's brain is called a _conversation agent_.
It is responsible for understanding the intention behind the spoken command,
performing an action, and generating a response.

Since the beginning of our voice journey, we allowed you to switch your
conversation agent for an LLM-based one. This led to some very funny experiments,
such as our [infamous interview with Mario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLx8_NAqptk).

Until now, these two worlds (our own Home Assistant conversation agent
controlling your home and LLM-based conversation agents) did not overlap;
it was impossible to control your home from an LLM-based conversation agent.

Today, we‚Äôre happy to announce that we are closing this gap!

<lite-youtube videoid="KXoIpwKsekY" videotitle="Demo of using Assist with an AI to control your smart home!"></lite-youtube>

When setting up an LLM-based conversation agent, you can decide to let
your conversation agent control your home with a flick of a switch.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-06/llm-based-conversation-agent-config-flow.png' alt='Screenshot of the configuration screen of the OpenAI integration, showing how to enable Home Assistant control.'>

With this new setting, LLM-based conversation agents can tap into our
{% term intent %} system, which powers Assist. They also get access to every
{% term entity %} exposed to Assist. That way, you control what your agents
have access to.

Tapping into our intent system is great because it works out of the box.
LLM-based conversation agents can do everything that Assist can do.
The added benefit is that they are capable of reasoning beyond words,
which Assist was incapable of doing.

For example, if you have a light called _"Webcam light"_ exposed in your
_"office"_ area, you can give direct commands such as:

> Turn on the office webcam light.

That was also working with Assist previously, but you can also give more
complex commands, such as:

> I'm going to a meeting, can you please make sure people see my face?

The agent will figure out the intention behind the words
and call the correct intent on the matching exposed entities.

{% details "What about custom intents?" %}

Our intent system has been built from the start to be extensible.
Custom integrations and even users can register their own intents.
This allows you to guide the agent beyond what's capable out of the box.

Here is an example of a custom intent that explains to the agent what
to do when I leave my home.

```yaml
conversation:
  intents:
    LeaveHome:
      - "Leave home"

intent_script:
  LeaveHome:
    description: "Launch the leave home script. To be used when I am about to leave my home."
    action:
      - service: script.leave_home
        data: {}
    speech:
      text: "Done"
```

With this YAML snippet added to my {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}, if the
agent understands that I am leaving home, it will not turn off what it thinks
I want, it will run my `leave_home` script, which is precisely what
I want it to do.

{% enddetails %}

This release makes it available for our [OpenAI] and [Google AI]
{% term integrations %}. To make it easier to get started with LLMs,
we have updated them with recommended model settings that strike the right
balance between accuracy, speed, and cost. If you had them set up previously,
we recommend enabling the recommended settings and emptying the instructions.

Our recommended model settings perform equally well for voice assistant tasks.
Google is 14x cheaper than OpenAI, but OpenAI is better at answering non-smart
home questions. We are preparing a blog post with a deep dive into the research
that went into this feature, coming soon‚Ñ¢!

Local LLMs have been supported via [the Ollama integration](/integrations/ollama/) since Home Assistant 2024.4. Ollama and the major open source LLM models are not tuned for tool calling, so this has to be built from scratch and was not done in time for this release. We're collaborating with NVIDIA to get this working ‚Äì [they showed a prototype last week.](https://youtu.be/aq7QS9AtwE8?si=yZilHo4uDUCAQiqN)

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this feature! [@shulyaka], [@tronikos],
[@allenporter], [@synesthesiam], [@jlpouffier], and [@balloob]!

### Improved media player commands

We have introduced new media player {% term intents %} that allow you to do
more while saying less. You can say the following voice commands to control
media players in the same area as your Assist device:

- _"Pause"_
- _"Resume"_
- _"Next"_
- _"Set the volume to 50%"_

Up until now, we have only proposed sentences targeting a specific entity by
its name. Due to this limitation, these intents were not the most user-friendly,
as the sentences were too long to say:¬†_‚ÄúSkip to the next song on the TV‚Äù_.

We added two features to get to the smallest sentences possible. Context
awareness makes our voice assistant aware of the devices in the same area as
the satellite. We have also created a smart matching strategy that finds the
right media player to target.

For example, if you say ‚Äúpause‚Äù, the voice assistant will automatically
target the media player that is playing.

<lite-youtube videoid="pFmwY-k5IcU" videotitle="Demo of media player commands of Home Assistant Assist"></lite-youtube>

Just ensure your voice assistant device is assigned to an area with an exposed
media player, and you are good to go.

## Dashboards

Work has continued, making the dashboard customization and organization easier
and more intuitive. This month, we are adding a new feature for our new sections
and customization for backgrounds, which everyone in your home will enjoy.

### Show sections conditionally

We added a visibility option to the new [sections dashboard] feature. This
amazing new feature allows you to hide or show a section based on certain
conditions.

For example, you may want to display only a section on mobile when you‚Äôre at
home. Or, only show the switch to turn off kitchen lights when the kitchen lights
are actually on. Maybe you have that one section only relevant to you or your
partner, and you want to hide it from the kids.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-06/dashboard-section-visibility.png' alt='Screenshot showing how to conditional make a section visible on the new sections dashboard.'>

It uses the [same conditions as condition cards](/dashboards/conditional/#conditions-options),
meaning you have a lot of flexibility in what you can do.

[sections dashboard]: /dashboards/sections/

### Control visibility of cards

Wait, we didn't stop there! This same visibility feature is now also available
for cards! Oh yes! üöÄ

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-06/dashboard-card-visibility.png' alt='Screenshot showing a tile card that is only visible to a specific person.'>

You can now hide or show a card based on certain conditions. This allows you to
create more dynamic dashboards that adapt to your needs. The big difference is
that you don‚Äôt need a condition card to use this feature. It is available
directly in the card configuration in the **Visibility** tab.

### Setting a dashboard background

[@Nezz] contributed a great new feature to our dashboarding UI: the ability to
set a background image for your [dashboard](/dashboards)!

Previously, this was only possible by editing YAML, but now you can do it
directly from the UI. Even better, you can upload an image directly from your
computer or provide a URL to one!

The same ability (to upload images directly from your computer) was added to
the picture card, too! Thanks,¬†[@karwosts], for that one!

## Data tables improvements

Like the [last release](/blog/2024/05/01/release-20245/#more-features-for-our-data-tables),
this release keeps improving our data tables.

When we [introduced data groupings](/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#item-grouping)
in the tables, you asked for a way to collapse and expand those groupings,
so we did in the last release! But then we quickly realized that it was not
enough, and you wanted to be able to collapse and expand all groups at once.
So, we did that for this release!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-06/data-tables-collapse-expand-all.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new collapse and expand all feature of our data tables.'>

We've also expanded the voice assistant expose data table to allow grouping
by area and domain.

Additionally, filters you've set in the data tables are now saved in your
browser session. Meaning, if you navigate away from the page and come back, your
filters will still be there. But! Each browser tab or window has its own session,
meaning you can have different filters in different tabs or windows that are
remembered for that specific tab or window.

### Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations

It is not just new {% term integrations %} that are added; existing
integrations are also constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:

- Do you need a wireless device that can bridge a larger distance, like
  kilometers? A [LoRa] device might be a good option. Thanks to [@angelnu]
  we now have a working integration for [The Things Network].
- [@starkillerOG] added support for PIR and battery sensors to the [Reolink]
  integrations. Nice!
- The [Teslemetry] integration has been expanded tremendously, adding new
  platforms and features. Awesome job [@Bre77]!
- Limited templates can now be used to disable {% term triggers %},
  {% term conditions %}, and {% term actions %}. [@farmio] thought this might
  be helpful for {% term blueprint %} creators.
- [@Anrijs] added support for the [Aranet Radiation] devices to the
  [Aranet] integration. Nice!
- You can now set the cutting height of your [Husqvarna Automower] and there
  are switches to make it stay out of certain zones. Thanks [@Thomas55555]!
- [@thomaskistler] added flow and rain sensor support to the [Hydrawise]
  integration. Great!
- The [SwitchBot Cloud] integration now supports the [SwitchBot Meter],
  [MeterPlus], and [Outdoor Meter]. Thanks [@laurence-presland]!

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[File]**, done by [@jbouwh]
- **[Jewish Calendar]**, done by [@yuvalabou]
- **[Media extractor]**, done by [@joostlek]
- **[The Things Network]**, done by [@angelnu]

[The Things Network]: /integrations/thethingsnetwork

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **Ambiclimate** has been removed by [@gjohansson-ST]. Their services have been
  terminated, effective March 31, 2024.

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#116410]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116410

## Matter turns 1.3

As one of the first in the industry, we proudly announce that Home Assistant
is already based on the latest {% term Matter %} specification: Matter 1.3! üòé
This updated version of the Matter SDK improves the reliability
and compatibility of Matter devices.

This release also improves and expands device support. Matter-based
air purifiers and room air conditioner devices are now supported, thermostats
and other climate devices had important fixes around set points, and updates
to our discovery ensure that we can represent more data for most devices.

A couple of Matter devices out there have so-called "custom clusters".
Custom clusters are a standardized way for manufacturers to include
non-standardized data. We want to support custom clusters, so we need
to add support for each one individually.

This release allows Home Assistant to be notified when the data of a custom
cluster changes (instead of polling for it on an interval). This will reduce the
network traffic and improve the performance of your Matter network,
especially on bigger {% term Thread %} networks.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- A default code can now be set in the entity settings for every alarm control
  panel {% term entities %}. Nice work [@gjohansson-ST]!
- [@Troon] added a filter to our {% term templates %}: `add`. This filter allows
  you to add a value similar to the existing `multiply`. Great!
- A new action building block has been added to our {% term automations %} and
  {% term scripts %}  by [@surfingbytes] and [@frenck]: [Run sequence of actions].
  This allows you to group multiple {% term actions %} together or run multiple
  sequences of actions in [parallel].
- Sensors can be [grouped] to calculate, for example, their sum or mean value.
  Thanks to [@CoRfr], it is now possible to calculate the [standard deviation]
  of a group of sensors. Cool!

### Disabling expiration of login tokens

A few releases ago, we introduced the automatic expiration of logins. If a login
session wasn't used for 90 days, it would expire and be automatically cleaned up.

Some of you have expressed that you would like to disable this feature for
various reasons. For example, because of a secondary holiday home one doesn‚Äôt
regularly visit, or because of relatives who can only come over a few times
a year. We added a new option to the user profile settings to disable
the expiration of specific login tokens.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-06/disabling-expiration-login-tokens.png' alt='Screenshot showing the option to disable the expiration of tokens in the profile page.'>

You can find these token in your profile settings, under the **Security** tab.

{% my profile badge %}

### Tag entities!

Home Assistant has had support for tags for a long time. The tags feature
allowed NFC tags or QR codes to be used with Home Assistant, for example, to
trigger {% term automations %}.

However, tags were not real entities and, thus, not always as logical to use.
With this release, [@gjohansson-ST] changed this!

Tags are now normal {% term entities %} and can be used in {% term automations %},
{% term scripts %}, {% term templates %}, and even be added to your
your [dashboards](/dashboards)!

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST

### Collapsible sections for blueprints!

[@karwosts] makes an appearance again this release with another one of his QoL
(Quality of Live) improvements. He added the ability to add collapsible sections
to {% term blueprints %}. This allows blueprint creators to group configuration
options together or hide advanced or less common options by default.

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-06/blueprint-input-sections.gif" alt="Screenrecording showing sections of Blueprints inputs being collapsed/uncollapsed."/>
    Each section can be collapsed or uncollapsed by clicking on the section header.
</p>

Thanks [@karwosts]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Anova" %}

The `State` and `Mode` entities for Anova devices have been changed to match the
new protocol messaging. Any automations based on these entities will need to be
updated.

([@Lash-L] - [#109508]) ([documentation](/integrations/anova))

[@Lash-L]: https://github.com/Lash-L
[#109508]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109508

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!Box Tools" %}

The previously deprecated services `reboot`, `reconnect`, and `cleanup` have
been removed. Please use the corresponding button entities instead.

([@mib1185] - [#118108]) ([documentation](/integrations/fritz))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#118108]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/118108

{% enddetails %}

{% details "File" %}

The notify services for the file integration now require that the file path
is an allowed path. You should check the accessed file is in the
[allowlist_external_dirs](/integrations/homeassistant/#allowlist_external_dirs)
to ensure your automations keep working.

([@jbouwh] - [#116861]) ([documentation](/integrations/file))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#116861]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116861

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT Lock now supports the lock¬†`open`¬†and¬†`opening`¬†states. When a lock is used
in¬†`optimistic`¬†mode, its state will become¬†`open`¬†instead of¬†`unlocked`¬†when
it is opened.

([@jbouwh] - [#117110]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#117110]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117110

---

The behavior on processing  empty and `"None"` state payloads for MQTT entities
has been made more predictable for `alarm_control_panel`, `climate`, `cover`,
`device_tracker`, `lock`, `select`, `valve`, and `water_heater` items:

- A "None" (string) for a state payload generally means the state
  becomes `unknown`.
- An empty payload is ignored.

Previously, a "None" state could be considered invalid or ignored.

([@jbouwh] - [#117813]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#117813]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117813

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenWeatherMap" %}

Migration to the new library with support of OneCall API (3.0).

OWM API v2.5 will be closed in June 2024. All OpenWeatherMap integrations must
be migrated to mode (API) v3.0 to avoid service interruption.

Before the migration, you must have an active subscription (be aware that
subscription activation takes up to 2h). After the subscription is activated,
users can migrate integrations to mode v3.0 via repair notification or manually
via the integration configuration menu.

The subscription has a free tier with 1000 calls/day. Consider setting the limit
on the OpenWeatherMap website to stay under the threshold where API usage
incurs a cost.
