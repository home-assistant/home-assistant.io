## Voice & Assist

This month, we are continuing our work on improving Assist capabilities out of
the box: Not only are we adding features, such as media control, that you would
expect from a voice assistant, we are leapfrogging ahead with some new
exciting developments experimenting with AI!

We will have more to announce during, soon to be announced, Voice Chapter 7 live
stream. Keep an eye out for that!

### Dipping our toes in the world of AI using LLMs

Our voice assistant brain is called a **conversation agent**.
It is responsible for understanding the intention behind the spoken command,
performing an action, and generating a response.

Since the beginning of our voice journey, we allowed you to switch your
conversation agent for an LLM-based one. This led to some very funny experiments,
such as our [infamous interview with Mario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLx8_NAqptk).

Up until now, these two worlds (our own Home Assistant conversation agent
controlling your home, LLM-based conversation agents) were not overlapping,
it was impossible to control your home from a LLM-based conversation agent.

Today we're happy to announce that we are closing this gap!

<lite-youtube videoid="3V9Pj6XCels" videotitle="Temporary video that needs to be replaced"></lite-youtube>

When setting up an LLM-Based conversation agent you can decide to let your
conversation agent control your home with a flick of a switch.

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-06/llm-based-conversation-agent-config-flow.png" alt="Configuration screen of the OpenAI integration, showing how to enable Home Assistant control."/>
    Configuration screen of the OpenAI integration, showing how to enable Home Assistant control.
</p>

With this new setting, LLM-based conversation agents can tap into our intent system, which is what powers Assist. They also get access to every entity exposed to Assist. That way, you control what your agents have access to.

Tapping into our intent system is great because it works out of the box. Everything that Assist can do, LLM-based conversation agents can too. The added benefit is that they are capable of reasoning beyond words, which is something Assist was not capable of doing.

For example, if you have a light called "Webcam light" exposed in your "office" area, you can give direct commands such as

> Turn on the office webcam light.

That was also working with Assist previously, but you can also give more complex commands such as

> I'm going in a meeting, can you please make sure people see my face?

The agent will figure out the intention behind the words, and call the correct intent on the correct exposed entities.

{% details "What about custom intents?" %}

Our intent system has been built from the start to be extensible. Custom integration and even users can register their own intents. This allows you to guide the agent beyond what's capable out of the box.

Here is an example of a custom intent that explains to the agent what to do when I leave my home.
```yaml
conversation:
  intents:
    LeaveHome:
      - "Leave home"

intent_script:
  LeaveHome:
    description: "Launch the leave home script. To be used when I am about to leave my home."
    action:
      - service: script.leave_home
        data: {}
    speech:
      text: "Done"
```

With this YAML snippet added to my {% term "`configuration.yaml`" %}, if the agent understands that I am leaving home, it will not turn off what it thinks I want, it will run my `leave_home` script, which is precisely what I want it to do.

{% enddetails %}

This release makes it available for our [OpenAI](/components/openai_conversation/) and [Google AI](/components/google_generative_ai_conversation/) integrations. To make it easier to get started with LLMs, we have updated them with recommended model settings that strike the right balance between accuracy, speed and cost. If you had them set up previously, we recommend enabling the recommended settings and emptying the instructions.

Our recommended model settings perform equally well for voice assistant tasks. Google is 14x cheaper than OpenAI, but OpenAI is better at answering non-smart home questions. We are preparing a blog post with a deep dive into the research that went into this feature, coming soon.

_Thanks to everyone who contributed to this feature! [@shulyaka](https://github.com/shulyaka), [@tronikos](https://github.com/tronikos), [@allenporter](https://github.com/allenporter), [@synesthesiam](https://github.com/synesthesiam), [@jlpouffier](https://github.com/jlpouffier) and [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob)._

### Improved media player commands

We have introduced new media player intents that allow you to do more while saying less. Thanks to
two new features, you can say the following voice commands to control media players in the same area:

- "Pause"
- "Resume"
- "Next"
- "Set the volume to 50%"

Up until now, we were only proposing sentence targeting a specific entity by its
name. Due to this limitation, these intents were not the most user friendly to
use, as the sentences were pretty heavy to say: _"Skip to the next song on the TV"_.

We added two features to allow us to get to the smallest sentences possible. Context awareness makes
our voice assistant aware of the devices in the same area as the satellite. On top of that we have created
a smart matching strategy that finds the right media player to target. For example, if you say "pause",
the voice assistant will automatically target the media player that is playing.

<lite-youtube videoid="SAd5ZBOhaUg" videotitle="Temporary video that needs to be replaced"></lite-youtube>

Just make sure your voice assistant is assigned to an area that contains an
exposed media player, and you will be good to go.

_There is a lot more cooking in the voice kitchen. Keep a look out for Voice - Chapter 7 on June 26th!_

## Dashboards

Work has continued to make customization and organization of dashboards easier and intuitive. This month, we are adding a new feature for our new sections, as well as customization for backgrounds which everyone at your home would enjoy.

### Show sections conditionally

We added a visibility option to the new sections dashboard feature. It allows you to hide or show a section based on certain conditions.

For example, you may want to only display a section on mobile, when you're at
home, and when the kitchen lights are on.

It uses the [same conditions as condition cards](/dashboards/conditional/#conditions-options).
The big difference is, that you don't need a condition card to use this feature.
it is available directly in the section configuration, in the visibility tab
in the options of a section.

<lite-youtube videoid="hhELdXsyL9Q" videotitle="Temporary video that needs to be replaced"></lite-youtube>

### Setting a dashboard background

[@Nezz] contributed an great new feature to our dashboarding UI: The ability to
set an background image for your dashboard!

Previously, this was only possible by editting YAML, but now you can do it
directly from the UI. Even better, you can just directly upload an image from
your computer!

![Screenshot 2024-05-02 231131](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/431167/706dc550-1335-46ee-9673-6fced559c533)

This same ability to upload images directly from your computer, was added
to the picture card too! Thanks, [@karwosts] for that one!

_Note: Add a picture uploader to picture-card-editor (#18695) @karwosts__

## Data tables improvements

Just like the last release, this release keeps on improving our data tables.

When we introduced grouping of data in the tables, you've been asking for a way
to collapse and expand those groupings, so, last release, we did! But then
quickly realized that it was not enough, and you wanted to be able to collapse
and expand all groups at once. So, we did that for this release!

![CleanShot 2024-05-28 at 11 07 39@2x](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5662298/ff5645b1-18c0-4a7d-8b09-3e15ffa9cc0d)

Additionally, filters you've set in the data tables are now saved in your
browser session. Meaning, if you navigate away from the page and come back, your
filters will still be there. But! Each browser tab or window has its own session,
meaning you can have different filters in different tabs or windows that are
remembered for that specific tab or window.

Lastly, we've expanded the voice assistant expose data table to allow grouping
by area and domain.

![CleanShot 2024-05-15 at 10 51 08](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5878303/1603f219-8828-47f5-a4a7-603111f64f97)

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most integrations can be set up directly from the Home Assistant user
interface, some integrations were only available to set up via
YAML-configuration. We keep adding more integrations to the UI, making them
easier to set up and use for everyone.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[File]**, done by [@jbouwh]
- **[Jewish Calendar]**, done by [@yuvalabou]
- **[Media extractor]**, done by [@joostlek]
- **[The Things Network]**, done by [@angelnu]

### Farewell to the following

The following integrations are also no longer available as of this release:

- **Ambiclimate** has been removed by [@gjohansson-ST]. Their services have been
  terminated, effective March 31, 2024.

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#116410]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116410

## Matter turns 1.3

As one of the first in the industry, we are proud to announce that
Home Assistant is already based on the latest Matter specification: Matter 1.3!
The updated SDK should improve the reliability and compatibility of Matter
devices.

This release also improves and expands device support. Matter-based air purifier and room air conditioner devices are now supported, thermostats and other climate devices had important fixes around set points, and updates to our discovery schema ensures that we can represent more Matter data for most devices.

There are a couple of Matter devices out there that have custom clusters. Custom clusters are a standardized way for manufacturers to include non-standardized data. We want to support custom clusters and so we need to add support for each one individually. This release allows Home Assistant to be notified when the data of a custom cluster changes, instead of polling for it. This will reduce the network traffic and improve the performance of your Matter network, especially on bigger Thread networks.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- A default code can now be set in the entity settings for every alarm control
  panel entities. Nice work [@gjohansson-ST]!
- [@Troon] added a filter to our templates: `add`. This filter allows you to
  add a value, similar to the existing `multiply`. Great!
- A new action building block has been added to our automations and scripts
  by [@surfingbytes] and [@frenck]: [Run sequence of actions]. This allows you
  to group multiple actions together.
- Sensors can be [grouped] to calculate, for example, their sum of mean value.
  Thanks to [@CoRfr], it is now possible to calculate the [standard deviation]
  of a group of sensors. Cool!

[grouped]: /integrations/group
[Run sequence of actions]: /docs/scripts/#grouping-actions
[standard deviation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation

### Tag entities!

Home Assistant has support for tags for a long time. The tags feature allowed
for NFC tags or QR codes, to be used with Home Assistant, for example, to
trigger automations.

However, tags were not real entities, and thus not always as logical to use as
other entities. With this release, this has been changed by [@gjohansson-ST]!

Tags are now normal entities, and can be used in automations, scripts, templates,
and even been shown on your dashboard!

### Disabling expiration of login tokens

A few releases ago, we introduced the automatic expiration of logins. If a login
session wasn't used for 90 days, it would expire and be automatically cleaned up.

Some of you have expressed that you would like to disable this feature for
various reasons. For example, because of a secondary holiday home, one doesn’t
regularly visit, or because of relatives who can only come over a few times
a year, we added a new option to the user profile settings to disable
the expiration of specific login tokens.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-06/disabling-expiration-login-tokens.png' alt='Screenshot showing the option to disable the expiration of tokens in the profile page.'>

You can find these token in your profile settings, under the **Security** tab.

{% my profile badge %}

### Collapsable sections for blueprints!

[@karwosts] makes an appearance again this release with another of his QoL 
(Quality of Live) improvements. He added the ability to add collapsible sections
to {% term blueprints %}. This allows blueprint creators to group configuration
options together or hide advanced or less common options by default.

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-06/blueprint-input-sections.gif" alt="Screenrecording showing sections of Blueprints inputs being collapsed/uncollapsed."/>
    Each section can be collapsed or uncollapsed by clicking on the section header.
</p>

Thanks [@karwosts]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best, to avoid making changes to existing functionality that
potentially might have an unexpected impact on your Home Assistant installation.
Unfortunately, sometimes it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes, to make the transition as easy
as possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible
changes:

{% details "Anova" %}

The `State` and `Mode` entities for Anova devices have been changed to match the
new protocol messaging. Any automations based on these entities will need to be
updated.

([@Lash-L] - [#109508]) ([documentation](/integrations/anova))

[@Lash-L]: https://github.com/Lash-L
[#109508]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109508

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!Box Tools" %}

The previously deprecated services `reboot`, `reconnect`, and `cleanup` has been
removed. Please use the corresponding button entities instead.

([@mib1185] - [#118108]) ([documentation](/integrations/fritz))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#118108]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/118108

{% enddetails %}

{% details "File" %}

The notify services for the file integration now require that the file path
is an allowed path. You should check the accessed file is in the
[allowlist_external_dirs](/integrations/homeassistant/#allowlist_external_dirs)
to ensure your automations keep working.

([@jbouwh] - [#116861]) ([documentation](/integrations/file))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#116861]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116861

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT Lock now supports the lock `open` and `opening` states. When a lock is used
in `optimistic` mode, its state will become `open` instead of `unlocked` when
it is opened.

([@jbouwh] - [#117110]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#117110]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117110

---

The behavior on processing  empty and `"None"` state payloads for MQTT entities
has been made more predictable for `alarm_control_panel`, `climate`, `cover`,
`device_tracker`, `lock`, `select`, `valve`, and `water_heater` items:

- A "None" (string) for a state payload generally means the state
  becomes `unknown`.
- An empty payload is ignored.

Previously, a "None" state could be considered invalid or ignored.

([@jbouwh] - [#117813]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#117813]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117813

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenWeatherMap" %}

Migration to the new library with support of OneCall API (3.0).

OWM API v2.5 will be closed in June 2024. All OpenWeatherMap integrations must
be migrated to mode (API) v3.0 to avoid service interruption.

Before the migration, you must have an active subscription (be aware that
subscription activation takes up to 2h). After the subscription is activated,
users can migrate integrations to mode v3.0 via repair notification or manually
via the integration configuration menu.

The subscription has a free tier with 1000 calls/day. Consider setting the limit
on the OpenWeatherMap website to stay under the threshold where API usage
incurs a cost.

[@freekode]: https://github.com/freekode
[#116870]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116870

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Synology DSM" %}

The option to define a custom timeout has been removed. The timeout is set
static to a sane value of 30 seconds.

([@mib1185] - [#116815]) ([documentation](/integrations/synology_dsm))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#116815]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116815

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Webmin" %}

You may need to remove obsolete duplicated entities if this change affects you.

([@autinerd] - [#113084]) ([documentation](/integrations/webmin))

[@autinerd]: https://github.com/autinerd
[#113084]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/113084

{% enddetails %}

{% details "World Air Quality Index (WAQI)" %}

The state attributes of the WAQI air quality sensor have been removed.
The attributes have been replaced by individual sensors; use these instead.

([@joostlek] - [#116595]) ([documentation](/integrations/waqi))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#116595]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116595

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

With this release, you will need to update your `zwave-js-server` instance.

You must use `zwave-js-server` 1.35.0 or greater (schema 35).
- If you use the Z-Wave JS add-on, you need at least version 0.5.0.
- If you use the Z-Wave JS UI add-on, you need at least version [3.4.2](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave-js-ui/releases/tag/v3.4.2).
- If you use the Z-Wave JS UI Docker container, you need at least version [9.10.0](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-ui/releases/tag/v9.10.0).
- If you run your own Docker container or some other installation method, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance to at least 1.35.0.
