Since I, the developer of HASSbian, have been moving, started a new job and so on I've had few moments over for HASSbian development. The 1.2 release has been in pre-release for a few months now and just not communicated out that well. Hopefully this release changes that and I'll do my best to release more often. There's no simple way to update from 1.1 to 1.21 but 95% of the changes can be done by installing the [hassbian-config][hassbian-config-release] package. For more information have a look at the [hassbian-config][hassbian-repo] page.

### {% linkable_title Hassbian-config %}

To allow you to customize your installation further, we have included a tool called `hassbian-config`. This tool comes with a set of packages that can easily be installed for easier customization of your Home Assistant installation. This replaces the `hassbian-scripts` functionality from 1.1.

  - Install Samba. Allows anyone on your network to edit your configuration from any computer. This share is unsecured and it's usage is not recommended if you share your network with others.
  - Install Libcec. Adds local [HDMI CEC support][cec].
  - Install Mosquitto MQTT server. Installs the latest Mosquitto package and client tools from the Mosquitto projects official repository. Now includes websocket support.
  - Install Open Z-Wave. Installs Open Z-Wave and prepares for using a USB or GPIO ZWave controller.
  - Install Hue. hue: Configures the Python executable to allow usage of low numbered ports for use with Emulated Hue component thats used with Amazon Echo, Google Home and Mycroft.ai.
  - Install Tellstick. Installs the Tellstick package for controlling and using a connected Tellstick.

### {% linkable_title Spring cleaning %}

With this image there also quite a bit of cleaning of the base system and the script that generates our Raspberry Pi image.

  - Replaced the `hassbian-scripts` folder with `hassbian-config`.
  - Update pi-gen. Our build script has been upgraded to follow the Raspbian image closer once again. Now you could build this image with Docker if your so inclined.
  - Added libtool & autoconf  package. Dependencies for some of the pip packages.
  - Pi ZeroW should now work with the image.
