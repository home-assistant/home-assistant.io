## There is a lot todo!

There are lots of things to do and that is what [@allenporter] realized too!
We now have a new entity type in Home Assistant: `todo`!

A todo entity represents a lists of tasks, and the state of the entity
will be the amount of tasks that are still open.

Besides the entities, it also comes with a bunch of new services you can
use to manage your tasks. For example, you could automate the creation of
tasks based on things happening in your house, or even create tasks from
your automations!

_insert image of local todo list in the dashboard_

You can create one, or more todo lists and view and manage them by selecting
the new **To-do lists** in the sidebar.

Thanks [@allenporter], for this amazing adition to Home Assistant!

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter

## Shopping lists are now TODOs too!

These todo-lists look a lot like the shopping list, right? Yup!
So, shopping list integration has been updated to use the new todo entity type.
Once you upgrade to this release, your shopping list will automatically be
converted to a todo list.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/todo-shopping-list.png' alt='Screenshot showing the shopping list, which now is a todo list.'>

## Integrations providing your todos

This release brings the local todo-list and the shopping list, but there is more!
Now we have a todo entity, we can also start using it in other integrations that,
for example, get their data (and thus your todo lists) from an external service.

You can now integrate your [Todoist] and [Google Tasks] todo lists in Home Assistant!

_insert image of to a nicely/fully loaded todo dashboard_

[Todoist]: /integrations/todoist
[Google Tasks]: /integrations/google_tasks

## Custom state content for Tile cards

Tile card now display the state of the entity in the card. But what if you want
to display something else? [@piitaya] to the rescue! 

You can now customize it to your liking. Show the state of the entity, any of its
attributes, or a combination of both!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/customize-tile-card-state-content.png' alt='Screenshot showing the configuration dialog of the tile card, which now allows you to set custom state contents.'>

This not only works for the climate entities, but for all entities! You could,
for example, add the brightness % of a light or the battery level of a sensor.
Simply add the attribute to the state content and drag and drop them in the
order you want them to appear.

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya

## Matter 1.2 is here!

The Connectivity Standards Alliance has launched [version 1.2 of the Matter specification](https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-1-2-arrives-with-nine-new-device-types-improvements-across-the-board/), together with a new version of the Official Matter SDK, which is not only prepared for new device types but also contains all kinds of smaller stability- and bug fixes.

Although you can not yet benefit of any of the new device types yet until actual devices are released, we have bumped our Matter implementation to version 1.2 to benefit from the stability improvements and to be prepared for the new device types.

Interesting fact: Did you know that Home Assistant is used as a test platform by many device manufacturers? This potentially means that devices will be implemented and tested on the Home Assistant Matter controller before others; cool!

## Custom date ranges in the energy dashboard!

The energy dashboard now allows you to select a custom date range. This allows
you to see the energy usage of your home over a specific period.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/date-range-energy-dashboard.png' alt='Screenshot showing the energy dashboard, which now allows you to select a custom date range.'>

Thanks, [@TillFleisch]!

## New conditions for the conditional card

The [conditional card](/dashboards/conditional/) is a great way to show or hide
cards conditionally. For example, you can show a card only when the sun is
setting, or when you are home.

When using such a state, you also match it against multiple values. For example,
you can show a card when the sun is setting or when the sun is below the
horizon in a single condition.

But even more interesting, [@piitaya] added a whole bunch of new conditions
to this card for you to use!

[@piitaya]: https://github.com/piitaya

### User condition <!-- omit in toc -->

The user condition allows you to show or hide cards based on the user that is
currently logged in. This is useful if you have multiple users in your Home
Assistant instance and want to show or hide cards based on who is logged in.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/conditional-card-per-user.png' alt='Screenshot showing the configuration dialog of the conditional card, which now allows you to set which users to show the card at.'>

### Numeric state condition <!-- omit in toc -->

Similar to the state condition, the numeric state condition allows you to show
or hide cards based on the state of a numeric entity. This is useful if you
want to show or hide cards based on the temperature, humidity, or any other
numeric entity.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/conditional-card-numeric-state.png' alt='Screenshot showing the configuration dialog of the conditional card, which you can now configure an numeric condition on when to show the card.'>

### Screen condition <!-- omit in toc -->

Last but not least, the screen condition allows you to show or hide cards based
on the screen size of the device you are viewing Home Assistant on.

For example, you could show some cards only when viewing Home Assistant on a
desktop or tablet, and hide them when viewing Home Assistant on a mobile device.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/conditional-card-screen-type.png' alt='Screenshot showing the configuration dialog of the conditional card, which you can now configure an numeric condition on when to show the card.'>

## Restart in safe mode

You can now restart Home Assistant in safe mode. This will disable all custom
integrations and custom dashboard resources.

This is useful if you are experiencing issues with Home Assistant and want to
rule out custom integrations or custom dashboard resources as the cause.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-11/restart-in-safe-mode.png' alt='Screenshot showing the restart dialog, which now provides a new option: Restart Home Assistant in safe mode.'>

Want to get out of safe mode again? Just restart Home Assistant one more time.

This is helpful! Thanks, [@emontnemery]!

## Set up Improv devices, directly from Home Assistant!

If you bought a device that supports [Improv Wi-Fi](https://improv-wifi.com/)
over Bluetooth, and you are using Bluetooth in Home Assistant, you can now
set up your device directly from Home Assistant itself!

Home Assistant will discover your brand new device, and will help you set it up
and get it connected to your Wi-Fi network and add it to Home Assistant.

<video width="680px" controls autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/195327/278046046-dfcf3501-2563-4a1d-aac2-d4c27587d932.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Improv Wi-Fi is also supported by [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/components/esp32_improv#improv-via-ble).

## Configuring script fields for your script in the UI

Scripts have a really cool feature: fields. Fields allow you to define
variables in your script you can pass in when calling your script as a service,
which you can then use in your script. For example, you could create a script
that sends a notification to a specific person, and use a field to define the
message you want to send.

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Country selector

A new selector is available, that allows you to select a country. This is
selector can be used in your Blueprints, or, in the new script field editor
mentioned above. Thanks, [@gjohansson-ST]!

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62932417/273396112-687c0d44-be26-4ce9-ac68-89495bfa61a7.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Type checking in your templates

Last, but not least, [@raman325] extended our template engine with the ability
to check the type of a variable. This allows you to do things like:

{% raw %}

```yaml
{% if my_var is list %}
  # Do something
{% endif %}
```

and

```yaml
{% if my_var is datetime %}
  # Do something
{% endif %}
```

{% endraw %}

Read more about [complex type checking in our documentation](/docs/configuration/templating/#complex-type-checking).

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- The nice little two-pane view you see in the todo list, has also been
  added to the calendar dashboard. Nice [@bramkragten]!
- [ZHA] will now raise a repair issue, if it found out the network settings
  have changed externally. This helps you getting up and running again in
  no time. Thanks, [@puddly]!
- The [Fitbit] integration got a complete overhaul, can be set up via the UI
  and now supports Fitbit nutrition sensors. Thanks, [@allenporter]!
- [@rappenze] added event entities support to the [Fibaro] integration. Cool!

## Breaking changes

{% details "Demo" %}

In the unlikely event that you are using the demo integration, you will need to
ensure that your YAML configuration for demo integration is only enabled via
the integration domain key, and not via the entity platform configration. The
latter has been removed.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml

# This is correct
demo:

# This no longer works and should be removed
light:
  - platform: demo
```

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#100867]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#100867]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/100867

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenUV" %}

The OpenUV "UV Level" sensor has updated its possible state values so that
translations can occur. The new values are:

- `extreme`
- `high`
- `low`
- `moderate`
- `very_high`

If you previously used the state values of this sensor in your automations,
you will need to update them to use the new values.

[#101978]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101978

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenWeatherMap" %}

The OpenWeatherMap rain and snow sensors, now have a different unit of measurement (`mm/h` instead of `mm`) and a different device class (`precipitation_itensity` instead of `precipitation`).

[@MatteoGheza]: https://github.com/MatteoGheza
[#101485]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101485

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Transmission" %}

The option to set a custom polling interval has been removed. If you were using
custom interval and really need it, you can use the `homeassistant.update_entity`
in an automation to poll at your custom pace. See our documentation on
[defining a custom polling interval](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval)
for more information.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Västtrafik" %}

Västtrafik has upgraded all infrastructure for handling external access,
including handling user accounts for 3rd party applications.

This means that users of the older infrastructure now need to migrate to use
the new environment. Create a new account at
[https://developer.vasttrafik.se](https://developer.vasttrafik.se),
then [create a new application](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/applications)
and subscribe to the Planera Resa v4 API.

Next replace your old client identifier and secret in your Home Assistant
configuration.

For more information, see [this official post](https://developer.vasttrafik.se/news/3) from Västtrafik.

{% details "WeatherFlow" %}

The VOC device class has been removed from the air density sensor and
its unit of measurement has been changed to to kg/m³.

[@natekspencer]: https://github.com/natekspencer
[#101777]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101777

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Withings" %}

The Withings sleep sensors will now show only the data of last night instead
of an aggregation of the data since the day before noon.

([@joostlek] - [#101993]) ([documentation](/integrations/withings))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#101993]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101993

{% enddetails %}

{% details "World Air Quality Index (WAQI)" %}

The state attributes of the WAQI air quality sensor have been moved to their own
sensors. The previous state attributes are now deprecated and will be removed in
2024.5.

If you are using the state attributes of the WAQI air quality sensor, you will
need to update your automations to use the new sensors.

([@joostlek] - [#101217]) ([documentation](/integrations/waqi))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#101217]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/101217

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ZHA (King of Fans)" %}

Improved support for King of Fans (Hampton Bay) breaks previous workarounds
such as template fans ([example](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/king-of-fans-mr101z-missing-max-setting/267131/45))
or automations/scripts that set fan speed percentage or preset.

If you have an automation that sets speed it will now be at one speed higher.
If you set speed at 100% before it would actually set the speed at 75% but now
it will be 100%. If you have an automation that sets the preset to 'on' to get
100% speed, now the request will fail and you will have to change the speed
to 100% instead.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

With this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance.
You must use zwave-js-server `1.33.0` or greater (schema `33`).

  - If you use the Z-Wave JS add-on, you need at least version `0.2.1`.
  - If you use the Z-Wave JS UI add-on, you need at least version `2.2.3`.
  - If you use the Z-Wave JS UI Docker container, you need at least version `9.2.3`.
  - If you run your own Docker container or some other installation method,
    you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance to at least `1.33.0`.

---

Basic Command Class values were previously exposed as `number` entities and were disabled by default. They are now exposed as `light` entities and are enabled by default. If you have scripts or automations that use any of these `number` entities, they should be updated to use the new `light` entities instead. Any previously created `number` entities for this Command Class can safely be deleted once you have validated that your scripts and automations are up to date.
