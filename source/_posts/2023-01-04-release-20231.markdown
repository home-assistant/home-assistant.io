Happy New Year! üçæ

We wish you, and all the loved ones around you, all the best for 2023! ü•Ç

2023: What an exciting year this will be; [The year of the voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/)!
And not just that, many exciting things are expected this year. More spoilers
can be found in the [State of the Open Home 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D936T1Ze8-4)
recording on YouTube.

Starting this amazing year with: Home Assistant Core 2023.1! üéä

A fairly small release, as we all enjoyed our Holidays. Yet, the first traces
of the voice project are already visible: support for entity aliases!

Still, this release contains over 800 changes, most of which are
quality improvements, bug and stability fixes, and other minor improvements.
The perfect release to start the year with, an easy upgrade worth doing.

Enjoy the release!

## The year of the voice!

You should have heard about it by now; 2023 is [Home Assistant's year of Voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/)!
It is our goal for 2023 to let users control Home Assistant in their own
language. As covered by [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/27/23527790/home-assistant-voice-control-rhasspy-nabu-casa-smart-google-siri-alexa),
[ArsTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/with-voice-assistants-in-trouble-home-assistant-starts-a-local-alternative/),
and [many others](https://9to5google.com/2022/12/23/home-assistant-voice/).

The work on voice has already started by collecting intents in all the different
languages we want to support. Intents describe the user's intention with what
they've said (or written), so Home Assistant can understand what to do,
like the action to take and which devices are involved.

All the different possible intent sentences are now being collected in the
[Intents for Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/intents) GitHub
repository, and [we are looking for contributions](https://github.com/home-assistant/intents/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
So, feel free to jump in and help out!

An overview of the current status of all intents and languages can be found on
[this page](https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/). The page gives insight
into the parts we need help with.

Lastly, we are also looking for language leaders! Each language is maintained
by one or more language leaders. Language leaders are responsible for reviewing
their language's contributions and making sure they are grammatically correct.

Anyone can apply to become one. If you want to apply to be a language leader,
join us in [#devs_voice on Discord](/join-chat) or [open a discussion topic](https://github.com/home-assistant/intents/discussions).

## Entity aliases for voice assistants

The first little thing related to the voice project found in Home Assistant:
Aliases for entity names are now configurable via the UI.

Currently, configured aliases are used by Google Assistant and, of course, can
later be used by our own voice assistant.

These aliases are helpful in case you call the same device by multiple names
or when using a voice assistant in multiple languages at the same time.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-01/aliases.png' alt='Screenshot showing the alias editing capabilities added to the more info dialog of entities'>

The new aliases feature can be found on each entity's more information dialog
in the settings tab in the advanced section. If you use
[Home Assistant Cloud](https://www.nabucasa.com/), you can also manage your
entity aliases (and the devices to expose to Google Assistant) in your
[Home Assistant Cloud settings](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/cloud/).

Multi-language can be an important factor when using Google Assistant, as those
can be configured to support two languages at the same time. For example,
English and Dutch simultaneously. Aliases allow you to provide names
for translations as an alias. For instance, I have added
"Woonkamer stofzuiger" (Dutch) as an alias to my living room vacuum.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-01/aliases-cloud-multi-language.png' alt='Screenshot showing adding multiple languages as aliases via the Home Assistant Cloud manage entities screen'>

It was previously possible to configure Google Assistant-specific aliases via
YAML as well, and this remains working. You can use either YAML or easily manage
them via the UI.

## Progress on Matter

Last December release, we [introduced Matter support](/blog/2022/12/07/release-202212/#it-does-matter),
and progress has been made since then. The code base has seen many fixes and
improvements, and much effort has been put into adding more automated
tests and quality assurance.

There are also notable improvements; commissioning Matter devices have been
improved (and fixed). So, adding [your first Matter device](https://nabucasa.github.io/matter-example-apps/)
to Home Assistant should be a much better experience now.

Lastly, the [Home Assistant Companion app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android)
with support for pairing Matter devices has been released! Thanks to the fantastic
work by [@jpelgrom](https://github.com/jpelgrom) on the Android app, the
commissioning experience is now even better! Here is a quick video showing
how that works:

<lite-youtube videoid="ELBrpnbRT-8" videotitle="Commission a Matter device with Home Assistant using the Home Assistant Companion app for Android"></lite-youtube>

This does require your Android device to be updated with Matter support which
Google is rolling out within the Google Home app in recent Android versions.

Support for pairing Matter devices using our iOS Companion app is being worked
on.

## Extending calendar support

The last release introduced [the local calendar](/blog/2022/12/07/release-202212/#local-calendar),
which included the capability to manage calendar events from Home Assistant.
These features have now been added to the [Google Calendar](/integrations/google/)
integration as well!

Meaning you can now create a new event in your Google Calendar, straight
from within Home Assistant. Neat!

Furthermore, the local calendar has been extended to provide editing support for existing
events ü§ò

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-01/calendar.png' alt='Screenshots showing the new edit event and monthly recurrence of events capabilities'>

Lastly, support for monthly variations in the recurrence rules has been
added. This includes repetitions like: on the 20th day or the first Wednesday of
the month. The latter, of course, is helpful to put the Home Assistant
release day on your calendar üòâ

## Translation improvements for entities

The support for translations for entities has been improved, especially those
of entity attributes! A relatively small change that is improving the UI
experience quite a bit.

Some entities provide additional properties, for example, climate entities
provide presets or fan modes. Integrations can now offer translations for
those attribute values.

Additionally, textual sensor entities can now provide a list of possible states
they can be in, for which, of course, translations can be provided for now too.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-01/entity-translations.png' alt='Screenshots showing the effects of having translated entity attributes'>

In the above screenshot, on the left, you can see how the presets of my
thermostat now show up nicely in a human-readable format (instead of, for example,
"anti_frost" in previous releases).

On the right, the [Moon](/integrations/moon) sensor used in an automation
trigger, Home Assistant can now suggest states you can use in those cases.
Those suggestions will also be translated into the language you are using.

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- [@epenet] added a bunch of new device classes for sensors! We now have support
  for data size, data rate, irradiance, sound pressure, and atmospheric pressure.
- The [Shelly] integration now supports the Shelly Plus WallDimmer US,
  thanks [@thecode]!
- Configuration errors of automations and scripts with device automations have
  been significantly improved, providing you with much more detail to help
  you fix the problem. Thanks, [@emontnemery]!
- [@AngellusMortis] added a text entity to the [UniFi Protect], so you can now
  set the message displayed on your doorbell. Awesome!
- [Google Translate] has been extended with dialect support, thanks [@toddejohnson]!
- [Yale Access Bluetooth] now has support for battery status, thanks [@bdraco]!
- Three nice new additions to [SwitchBot], [@konikoni428] added support for power
  monitor of wallplugs, [@bdraco] added initial humidifier support, and
  [@dsypniewski] added support for SwitchBot locks! Awesome!

  thank you!
- [KNX] expose now has a cooldown option, which can be used to limit bus load.
  Thanks, [@farmio]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Image Upload / Default Config" %}

The `image` integration domain was renamed to `image_upload`.

This change would only affect you when you have removed the
[`default_config`](/integrations/default_config) from your configuration.
In that case, you need to manually adjust your configuration to rename `image`
to `image_upload`.

The rename was done to free up the `image` domain for future use.

([@frenck] - [#84063]) ([documentation](/integrations/image_upload))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#84063]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/84063

{% enddetails %}

{% details "air-Q" %}

The unit for noise has been adjusted from `dBa` to `dBA`.

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#83581]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/83581

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AirVisual (Pro)" %}

AirVisual Pro units now have their own Home Assistant integration (as opposed
to be included with the original AirVisual integration that uses the AirVisual
cloud API).

Pro devices will automatically be migrated; as part of that migration,
the Pro's device ID will change.

If you utilize entity IDs belonging to a Pro in automations or scripts, you
don't need to do anything; if, however, you utilize a Pro's device ID,
please update those automations or scripts accordingly.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "APC UPS Daemon" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the APC UPS Daemon integration
has been removed.

APC UPS Daemon is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML configuration
has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely removed from your
YAML configuration files.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "deCONZ" %}

An issue with the mapping of triggers of Styrbar has been discovered and fixed.
As a result, any automations relying on these triggers will need to be
manually adjusted/re-configured to adjust to this change.

{% details "Speedtest.net" %}

update it at your own custom schedule.

configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.
