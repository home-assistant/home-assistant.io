It's time for Home Assistant 0.42. This release has been focused on refining the system and fixing a lot of bugs. We have also upgraded to the latest version of our HTTP library which should give us a significant boost serving files and API.

On our social media front, we have crossed the 1000 likes on [our Facebook page][hass-fb]! Also on the social media front, the YouTube channel diyAutomate has been putting out a lot of great getting started videos about Home Assistant, [go check them out!][diyAutomate]

Also want to take a moment to thank Austin Andrews aka [Templarian] for his [Material Design Icons][mli]. He is part of what makes Home Assistant so beautiful ðŸ¤—.

## Backward-incompatible changes

- We were incorrectly treating groups named `default_view` as default views. Make sure you set `view: true` in the config for these groups. [#251 (frontend)](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/pull/251)
- The last release introduced a revamped LIFX platform. We only realized after deploy that this version does not work on Windows. We have added the old LIFX implementation back as `lifx_legacy`.
- We added indexes to the database to speed up the history view. Initial boot can take a couple of minutes. Do not shut down while migration is occurring. [#6688]
- Z-Wave cover workaround has been removed. Use device config instead. [#6832]

```yaml
zwave:
  device_config:
    cover.my_cover:
      invert_openclose_buttons: true
```

- If you set an initial state for an automation, input_boolean, input_slider or input_select it will overrule over the previous state. [#6911] [#6924]
- Z-Wave rename node service parameter `entity_id` has been replaced with `node_id` to align parameters [#6938]
- Automations are now initialized when Home Assistant finishes starting up. This means that it is deprecated to listen for event `homeassistant_start`. Instead, use the new `homeassistant` automation platform. [#6936]

```yaml
automation:
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
```

- The Ring component has moved the authentication to a dedicated ring component. [#6520]

```yaml
ring:
    username: !secret ring_username
    password: !secret ring_password

binary_sensor:
  - platform: ring
    monitored_conditions:
      - ding
      - motion

sensor:
  - platform: ring
    monitored_conditions:
      - battery
      - last_activity
      - last_ding
      - last_motion
      - volume
```
