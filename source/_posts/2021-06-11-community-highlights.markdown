The 25th edition of the Home Assistant Community Highlights! Some interesting
things popped up around our community, which we thought was worth sharing.

Also, keep an eye out for the ESPHome release next week Wednesday. We're
going to have some great announcements!

Do you want to share something for the next edition?

## Blueprint of the week
------

Are there more people who turn their lights on and off at certain times
when they go on holiday?

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/vacation-lighting-replay-historical-lighting/282435" %}

This week's blueprint is that of [timgiwo](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/timgiwo),
who created a blueprint that can repeat the behavior of your lights from
the past week, so it seems like you are still at home. Try it out! Read more
about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or install this automation
in your instance with a click on the My button!

## Slider Button Card
------

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/mattieha/slider-button-card" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-06-11-community-highlights/button.gif'
            alt="Preview of the button slider card"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

[Mattieha](https://github.com/mattieha) made a [button card](https://github.com/mattieha/slider-button-card)
that also included a slider, so you could, for example: switch a light but
also immediately adjust the brightness with the slider. Useful for those who
want to keep their dashboard compact.

## Floorplan Dashboard
------

This week again we have a new Lovelace dashboard for the necessary portion
of inspiration üòÑ This time the one from [theone11](https://github.com/theone11)
who has a [dashboard](https://github.com/theone11/HomeAssistantConfig) with a
floorplan, definitely recommended to take a look at the repository because
there is a lot of explanation on it.

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center; margin-bottom:15px">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_AKHEyWXR0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Would you also like your dashboard to be in the community highlight? Drop it
on [Reddit][reddit] and maybe I'll pick it out for the next edition.

## Ispindel

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/alsFC/esphome-iSpindel" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-06-11-community-highlights/ispindel.png'
            alt="Preview of the ISpindel project"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Between the community submissions, we came across a [nice project](https://github.com/alsFC/esphome-iSpindel)
that works with [ESPHome][esphome], it's a sensor with which you can
monitor your own homebrew, for example, the alcohol percentage and the
temperature. Cheers [Alexander](https://github.com/alsFC)! üçª
