## Icons

We updated the way we load icons, with the ever growing Material Icons set, it was necessary to update the way we handle icons to make sure our application stays performant.
We splitted the Material Icons in chunks, so you don't have to load all the icons if you just need one, besides that we no longer store the icons in the DOM but in a database.
This saves a lot of memory and thus makes Home Assistant leaner and faster!

## Weather card

We got a lot of feedback about the updated weather card of the last release, we listened and added some features.
You can now theme the colors of the new icons, and you can even completely replace them with an other image. You can also set the attribute you want to show as the secondary info.

Check the [docs](/lovelace/weather-forecast/) for more info

## Calendar panel

Thanks to [@zsarnett] we got a beautiful new calendar panel! It shows you all items of the calendars you select in a month, week or day view.
There is also a calendar card for Lovelace in the making.

## Supervisor

Have you seen the new supervisor UI? [@ludeeus] did a great job redoing it's UI! It now uses the same tabs as the configuration panel. The addon page is split into multiple tabs, the addon store is cleaned up and you can view all logs in system tab now (requires expert mode).

Some advanced addons are now also marked "expert" and are only visible when you are in expert mode.

## Integrations grouped and search

[@timmo001] added the possibility to search your integrations, so you can find what you are looking for quickly.

We also grouped the entries by integration now, this means we no longer show multiple cards for the same integration, but show a list of the names if there are multiple entries. If you click the entry it will show that entry in the card. This makes it easier to keep an overview of all your integrations.

## Breaking Changes

- **Manual Alarm Panel** - When going from state `disarmed` to any other (armed) state such as `armed_away`, the state will be `arming` instead of `pending` during the transition time as set in the configuration. When going from an armed state (such as `armed_away`) to the `triggered` state the state will still be `pending` during the transition time as set in the configuration (as it was before). - ([@starkillerOG] - [#32950]) ([manual docs])

   - State attribute `pre_pending_state` changed to `previous_state`

   - State attribute `post_pending_state` changed to `next_state`

   - Config option `pending_time` is renamed to `arming_time`, functionality is the same.

   - The time the alarm stays at `pending` when triggered has changed from `delay_time` of the previous state + `arming_time` (previously known as `pending_time`) of the triggered state to only the `delay_time` of the previous state.

- **Cert Expiry** - The "name" config option marked as deprecated in 0.107 has been removed and will now cause errors on startup if it remains in the configuration. You should change your configuration accordingly. - ([@jjlawren] - [#34628]) ([cert_expiry docs]) 
- **Nederlandse Spoorwegen** - The punctuality attribute has been removed from the integration. Ever since NS updated its API a few months ago, its behavior with regards to the punctuality has been incoherent, sometimes even missing from the API's response. This has caused numerous Issues to be created in this repo by users getting errors that the punctuality attribute was unlike what the integration was expecting. - ([@YarmoM] - [#34680]) ([nederlandse_spoorwegen docs]) 
- **Fortigate** *(Deprecated)* - The fortigate integration will be removed in 0.112.0 and has a replacement in the FortiOS integration.
Please refer to the fortios integration on how to configure the new parameters : https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fortios/ - ([@kifeo] - [#34854]) ([fortigate docs]) 
- **Raspberry Pi Camera** - To align with ADR 0007, configuration has been moved under `rpi_camera:` as its own platform. - ([@alxrdn] - [#34461]) ([rpi_camera docs]) 

  Old YAML configuration example:
  ```yaml
  camera:
  - platform: rpi_camera
    image_width: 1296
    image_height: 972
    image_quality: 75
  ```
  New YAML configuration example:
  ```yaml
  rpi_camera:
    image_width: 1296
    image_height: 972
    image_quality: 75
  ```
- **ONVIF** - ONVIF is now available to be added from the Integrations UI! The `extra_arguments` and `rtsp_transport` configuration from yaml is now a part of the Options flow for the integration, and is not automatically imported to the config flow with the rest of the defined ONVIF platforms. - ([@hunterjm] - [#34520]) ([onvif docs]) 

- **PulseAudio Loopback** - Internal library code has been replaced with the pulsectl library. - ([@breiti] - [#34965]) ([pulseaudio_loopback docs]) 
  - The default connection honors the configuration in /etc/pulse and no longer defaults to `localhost`.
  - When a host is configured, the default port has been changed to 4713 to use the native interface of PulseAudio.
  - The config parameters `buffer_size` and `tcp_timeout` have been removed.

- **UPnP** - This integration has been simplified and will always create sensors, so port mapping functionality has been removed. - ([@StevenLooman] - [#35191]) ([upnp docs]) 
  
  Example YAML configuration:
  ```yaml
  upnp:
  ```
  
- **ZHA** *(Deprecated)* - Configuration options for ZHA integration in configuration.yaml are deprecated and will be removed in 0.112.0. - ([@Adminiuga] - [#35161]) ([zha docs]) 

  Starting with the following radio configuration options:
  - `usb_path`
  - `baudrate`
  - `radio_type`

- **IMAP Email Content** - The *state* of the `imap_email_content` is replaced when there is no email found. With this change any other thing like an automation can react to the arrival of an email - ([@isk0001y] - [#35123]) ([imap_email_content docs]) 

- **Sony Songpal** - This is now enabled through the Integrations UI. To call `songpal/set_sound_setting` on all songpal devices, the `entity_id` now needs to be set to `all` instead of left unset. - ([@shenxn] - [#34714], [#35318]) ([songpal docs]) 

- **HTTP** - `base_url` is deprecated and replaced by an `internal_url` and `external_url` core configuration setting. - ([@frenck] - [#35224]) ([config docs]) ([http docs]) 

- **Kodi** - Kodi previously reported the media content type for all PVR channels as "channel", no matter if it was a TV or a radio channel. The media content type is now derived from the used player type, i.e. it reports as "music" for radio channels and "video" for TV channels. ([@Tho85] - [#35091]) ([kodi docs]) 

- **Mill** - Mill is now enabled through the Integrations UI and not configuration.yaml. - ([@Danielhiversen] - [#35136]) ([mill docs])

- **Homematic** - Automations relying on the numeric value for the garage door status might break, since the status will now be reported as human-readable strings. - ([@guillempages] - [#35349]) ([homematic docs])

- **Tuya** - Tuya is now enabled through the Integrations UI. - ([@ollo69] - [#35422]) ([tuya docs]) 
- **LG webOS Smart TV** - A new `unique_id` is used for `webostv` media players for users running a 0.109.X release. Duplicate entities will be created with new entity IDs and old entities will need to be manually removed. - ([@jjlawren] - [#34979]) ([webostv docs]) 

- **Universal Devices ISY994** - This migrates ISY994 to PyISY v2 and is now available to be added from the Integrations UI. PyISY Version 2 is a significant update to the original module used to communicate with the ISY. As part of the update and many bug fixes, some breaking changes were introduced:
  
  - Remove ISY Climate Module support: the ISY Climate Module was retired by UDI on 3/30/2020: UDI Announcement, support has been removed from the module, so  any entities based on Climate module nodes will no longer import into Home Assistant. The enable_climate configuration option will need be removed from your configuration.yaml file.
  - Device State Attributes have changed: some attributes' names and types will have changed as part of the changes to PyISY. If a user relied on a device state attribute for a given entity, they should check that it is still there and formatted the same. In general, more state attributes that were previously unavailable, should appear.
  - isy994_control events now return with additional information about the event. If a user relies on the control event property in Automations, these will need to be updated since the format has changed to include the additional detail.
  - Nodes that are "grouped" together in the ISY Admin Console will now be correctly identified and sorted, this will cause additional entities to be added to Home Assistant. If you were using this "group" feature to ignore some sub-devices in Home Assistant, you will now need to use the "ignore_string" in the name instead.
  - Turning on a light without providing a brightness value will use the ISY Device's On Level property instead of turning on to full brightness (if Home Assistant doesn't have a stored value for the last brightness).

  Sorting of certain devices based on the ISY's `Node Def ID` and `Insteon Type` properties have been corrected to match the ISY's provided device categories, as well as user feedback of incorrect sorting for specific devices. As a result, some entities that were incorrectly categorized will now appear under a different platform (e.g. switch to binary_sensor, light to switch, etc.)
  
  Both KeypadLinc Secondary Buttons and RemoteLinc2 Buttons have been moved from `switch` to sensor. This is because these buttons cannot actually be directly controlled via commands sent from the `switch` platform, doing so results in communication errors from the ISY because the commands are not valid. These devices are being moved to `sensor` instead of `binary_sensor` because they report a state in a range from `0` to `255`; `0`=Off, `255`=On according to their last brightness/dimming level sent.
  
  The ISY994 integration now includes a `restore_light_state` option. In 0.109.0, a change was made to restore a light's brightness to the previous state when turned on with no `brightness` parameter. This was, in part, to fix an issue where the light to turn on to full brightness when no parameters were given, regardless of the physical device's `On Level` brightness setting. Using the `On Level` is now supported and is the default behavior. To keep the current behavior and use Home Assistant's last brightness, set the `restore_light_state` to `True` or enable the option in the new config flow options.([@shbatm] - [#35212], [#35338], [#35413], [#35391] ) ([isy994 docs]) 

  The following device node types have changed platforms to correct their categorization.
  - "BinaryControl" (`SWITCH`->`BINARY_SENSOR`)
  - "BinaryControl_ADV" (`SWITCH`->`BINARY_SENSOR`; IOLinc Sensor)
  - "EZIO2x4_Input" (`SWITCH`->`BINARY_SENSOR`)
  - "EZRAIN_Input" (`SWITCH`->`BINARY_SENSOR`)
  - "OnOffControl" (`SWITCH`->`BINARY_SENSOR`)
  - "OnOffControl_ADV" (New; Thermostat Control/Running Sensors)
  - "EZIO2x4_Input_ADV" (`SWITCH`->SENSOR, Analog input on EZIO).
  - "RemoteLinc2" (`LIGHT`->`SWITCH`),
  - "RemoteLinc2_ADV" (`LIGHT`->`SWITCH`),
  - RemoteLincs only report button presses as events, are not controllable and do not accurately report dimmable states.
  - New Insteon Types for `BINARY_SENSOR`S: "7.0.", "7.13." (IOLinc/EZIO Sensors)
    - IOLinc sensor/control logic will be updated in PR-4 to sort them correctly into two different platforms.
  - New Insteon Type for `LOCKS`: "4.64." added.
  - New Insteon Types for `SWITCHES`: "0.16.", "7.3.255.", "9.10."
