## Home Assistant spring cleaning! 🧹 New ways to get your automations (and more) organized

By far, the most requested feature in Home Assistant history would be:

[_"Grouping Automations on frontend for organization"_](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/grouping-automations-on-frontend-for-organization/102771).

We hear you! Today, in this release, we are going to give you tools to organize
your Home Assistant setup, and we took it a few (well, many) steps further than
just grouping {% term automations %}!

We are introducing 3 (yes, you’ve read it correctly. It’s three) organization
taxonomies, and we also revamped our entire table user interface plus a few
goodies along the way.

## Upgraded tables!

Adding more ways to organize your Home Assistant is great! But being able to
easily view, filter, and navigate information is just as important. To achieve
this, we have re-designed ALL the tables in Home Assistant.

For an admin interface, tables are essential for visualizing and managing
large datasets. Home Assistant has many tables in its settings pages.
Previously, our UI provided the ability to search, sort, and filter for a few
aspects, but it was relatively barebones.

Today, we are rolling out a revamped table UI that will be standardized across
all tables in the settings pages with new and improved features.

### A new toolbar

As we add more features to the tables, we need to keep the UI clean and its
features easy to find. Therefore, we added descriptive text to the dropdown
menus and standardized the look and feel of the toolbar buttons and text boxes.
Shiny!

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-04/new-toolbar.png" alt="Screenshots showing the new toolbar that is now on every table in Home Assistant."/>

</p>

### Filter panel

Previously, our automations page allowed you to filter by {% term areas %},
{% term entities %}, or {% term devices %}, but only one at a time, and the
filters were tucked away in a dropdown menu, which meant you needed to select
a dropdown menu inside a dropdown menu to filter by area.

A new filter panel fixes these issues by providing a new dual pane user
interface that can let you check multiple filters across multiple filter
types on the left that stay put and view the filtered results on the right.

__TODO: Insert screenshot showing the filters active on the device automation
page.__

We also introduced multiple new filter types for each table. For example,
{% term automations %} can now be filtered not only by {% term areas %},
{% term entities %} , or {% term devices %}, but also by used
{% term blueprints %}, labels, and categories (more on these later!).

We didn’t stop at just that page! The devices and entities pages now also have
a way to filter not only by state but also by integrations and areas. Almost all
tables now have useful new filters to help you find what you are looking for.

### Item grouping

Browsing a list of hundreds of {% term automations %}  or thousands of 
{% term entities %} can be overwhelming. While filters can help narrow the list,
visually grouping the items into smaller chunks makes browsing easier.

With the item grouping feature, we introduced a new dropdown menu to pick
how you’d like the items on the table to be grouped. On the automations page,
you can group automations by their {% term state %} - whether enabled
or not - and custom categories (more on that later!). On the {% term devices %}
page, you can even group them by manufacturers, {% term areas %},
or {% term integrations %}, which is really cool because it makes the page much
easier to browse. It gives you a new perspective on organizing your vast
network of devices.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/item-grouping.png' alt='Screenshots showing data automations in a tables groups by their on/off state.'>

### Selection mode and batch actions

We removed the clutter of displaying a column of checkboxes by introducing
a new selection mode. When it is toggled on, checkboxes will appear, and you
can apply actions to all your selections with one click on the toolbar.

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-04/enable-selection-mode.png" alt="Screenshots point out the enable selection mode button in the toolbar of the tables in Home Assistant."/>
    This button enables selection mode in the new tables.
</p>

It allows you to, for example, enable or disable multiple selected
{% term entities %} on the entities page at once. This new paradigm will allow
us to introduce more batch management actions in the future.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/bulk-actions.png' alt='Screenshots showing selection mode active in a table, with some items selected, highlighting the bulk actions you can perform on those selected items.'>

## Three new ways to organize

Upon reading through and ideating on the feature request thread on
[“Automation Grouping”](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/grouping-automations-on-frontend-for-organization/102771),
we realize that organization can be done in multiple ways for different purposes.

We learned that users who are proficient in making {% term automations %} have
hundreds of them, which makes locating a particular automation hard. They often
had to resort to using "hacks" such as emojis, bracketed “tags”, or numbering
each automation to get the sort order they wanted. They needed a way to easily
filter down and break down the giant list into more manageable chunks.

We also noticed that users are stretching our areas feature beyond its
intended purpose. For example, some users would create “{% term areas %}” such
as “3D printer”, “Christmas decorations”, or even “Left side of my office desk”,
to group different {% term devices %} and {% term entities %} together under
one umbrella for dashboards or {% term automations %}.

As we are developing our new dashboards and voice commands, this poses a
big problem: We would be unable to provide specialized solutions if a dashboard
{% term blueprint %} or automation blueprint cannot confidently assume the context of
how it would be used. We need something more specialized.

Therefore, to balance the basic goal of providing a more digestible UI for
all users, the need for flexibility for our power users, and the future vision
of Home Assistant, we are introducing 3 new organization structures to
Home Assistant:

**[Floors](#floors-help-home-assistant-understand-your-house)**,
**[Labels](#labels-tag-everything-any-way-you-want)**,
and **[Categories](#categories-make-each-settings-page-easier-to-browse)**

### Floors: Help Home Assistant understand your house

Let's talk about the new organizational structures, starting with **floors**.

To become a truly intelligent home automation platform, Home Assistant needs
to understand the context: Where exactly is a {% term device%}? How does one
{%term area %} relate to another? What is the space used for?

Currently, Home Assistant has {% term areas %}. Areas specify the physical
location or vicinity of your devices per living space in your home
(like the living room or kitchen). However, some users living in standalone
houses might have multiple floors with their own areas.

{% term Floors %} are a new way to organize your areas per level of floors in
your home. The better Home Assistant knows your home and how it is spatially
structured, the better it can help you. Especially when it comes to future
features like generating dashboards, voice commands, and maybe even
AI-related features.

__TODO: Screenshot show areas page with floors.__

You can use floors in your {% term automations %} and {% term scripts %} as a
target for your actions or control them with your voice. For example, you can
turn off all the lights on the downstairs floor when you go to bed or ask
[Assist](/voice_control/) to turn on the lights upstairs.

For our power users, you can even use [floors in your templates](/docs/configuration/templating/#floors)
to create the most advanced and creative automations.

### Labels: Tag everything any way you want

{% term Floors %} and {% term areas %} are great for representing your actual
home, but as everyone has their own ways of organizing their home, everyone
has their own ways of organizing the Home Assistant, too!
This is where **labels** 🏷️ come in!

Labels is an organizational structure that is completely up to you. You can
make as many labels with any naming structure, in any color 🌈 you want, and
assign them to basically anything in Home Assistant. You assign labels to
anything: {% term areas %}, {% term devices %}, {% term entities %},
{% term automations %}, {% term scripts %}, helpers, you name it!
You can even assign multiple labels to the same thing.

![CleanShot 2024-03-27 at 08 46 10@2x](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5662298/582b75af-7352-4241-8bad-3a39873c99c6)

Just like with floors, you can use labels in your automations and scripts as
a target for your {% term actions %}. This gives you a lot of flexibility,
not just in organizing your Home Assistant, but also in automating your home! 🤯

For example, you could create a label "🎄 Christmas" to label all your
Christmas decorations during the holiday season. You can then use this label to
automate all of those decorations at once or to filter them in the new tables.

More examples? You could create a label "🔒 Security" to label and control all
your security-related devices and automations. Or, "🛌 Bedrooms" to label all
your bedroom areas and simultaneously control all the devices in those areas.

Do you have solar panels or home batteries? Create a label "⚡️ Heavy energy usage"
to label devices that consume a lot of energy. You could switch them off when
there is not enough battery or solar energy available.

You decide how to use labels, and the possibilities are endless! And for our
power users, you guessed it, you can use [labels in your templates](/docs/configuration/templating/#labels).

### Categories: Make each settings page easier to browse

Last but not least, we are introducing **categories**. Categories are designed
to be paired with the aforementioned [item grouping feature](#item-grouping),
and it can be used to group things visually specific to a certain table
in Home Assistant.

This is great for those who have a particular way of displaying their
{% term entities %} by separating them into multiple sections on a specific page.
For example, on the {% term automations %} page, you can create categories only
used for visually grouping automations but nowhere else, like "Notifications"
or “NFC tags”. You can then view your automations grouped or filtered by
those categories.

__TODO: Show screenshot with automations grouped by categories__

As these categories are unique for each dashboard, you can have different
sets of categories depending on the place you are organizing. This means
you can have different categories on the automations page than the
{% term scene %}, {% term scripts %}, or helpers settings page.

### Time to clean up your Home Assistant!

In summary, there are a total of 4 taxonomies for organizing your entities.
It sounds like a lot, but they all serve a distinct purpose. We are extending
and clarifying {% term areas %} with {% term floors %}, and we are introducing
{% term labels %} and {% term categories %} to make your {% term automations %}
and many other tables to look more organized and to be more manageable.

What’s next? Time to dig in! Here are a few steps we recommend you take
action on to organize your Home Assistant better:

- **Migrate to labels**:  
  - If you have been grouping automations with emojis and bracketed text,
    you can now create labels for each. Labels can have icons to replace the
    emojis you had before.
  - For areas that aren’t really physical spaces, switching them to labels will
    provide you more flexibility in organizing your entities.
- **Start using categories**:  
  If you have a favorite way of organizing a particular page, create those
  categories and group the table by them. For example, you could create a
  notification category for all your notification automations and put all
  notification automations in that category.
- **Group your areas into floors**:  
  If you live in a multi-story home, grouping areas into floors help with
  organizing the areas as well as making them more compatible with future
  features.

Last of all, to help us to help you to perfect the design of these new features,
we would love to hear your feedback and see how you use them! Please feel free
to share them in the comments below and discuss them in our community.

## Map dashboard

Introducing a new dashboard this release: The **map**! 🗺️

You might think, "Hey, we already have a map dashboard in Home Assistant!"
and you are right! However, the map was an integration that was always there
and didn't provide the flexibility and features that were wanted.

With the map dashboard's introduction, you could add multiple map dashboards
with different entities and configuration settings. For example, create a
dashboard to show the location of your family members, another to track your
car, and another to show the location of your pets. 🐶

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/dashboard-map.png' alt='Screenshots showing the new map dashboard you can add when you add a new dashboard to your Home Assistant.'>

On upgrade, Home Assistant will automatically migrate your existing map
integration to a map dashboard.

You don't like having the map in your sidebar? Well, that is no longer a
problem. Since it is now a dashboard it means you can remove in the dashboard
settings.

## Webpage dashboard

Another new dashboard for this release is the **webpage**! 🌐

The webpage dashboard allows you to add and embed a webpage to your dashboard.
This could be a web page from the internet or a local web page from a local
machine or device like your router or NAS.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/dashboard-webpage.png' alt='Screenshots adding a new webpage dashboard to Home Assistant, embeding the Home Assistant website.'>

This dashboard replaces the old iFrame panel (`iframe_panel`). If you have
existing panels configured in your YAML configuration, Home Assistant will
automatically migrate them to the new webpage dashboard on upgrade.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/embeded-home-assistant-website.png' alt='Screenshot showing the Home Assistant website embeded into the Home Assistant frontend using a webpage dashboard.'>

Note that not every webpage can be embedded due to security restrictions that
some sites or pages have in place, enforced by your browser, that prevent
embedding them into a Home Assistant dashboard.

## Define the columns in the section view

In the last release, we [introduced the section view](/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#a-new-experimental-sections-view)
with drag and drop support. We are absolutely thrilled to see how many of you
loved it! 🥰

Many thanks for all the feedback and suggestions! We are prioritizing them and
are working on making the section view even better in the upcoming releases.

In this release, based on your feedback, we have added the ability for you to
define the maximum number of columns in the section view uses. This allows you
to limit the number of columns, regardless of the screen width on which you
are viewing your dashboard.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/sections-dashboard-limit-columns.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new option available to limit the number of columns the section view uses.'>

## Adding matter devices from other controllers

In the [February release](/blog/2024/02/07/release-20242/#matter-diagnostics-and-actions),
we added support for sharing Matter devices tied to Home Assistant with other
Matter controllers. This release, we are making the other way around easier.

We have improved how you can add Matter devices from other controllers to
Home Assistant. When you add a Matter device to Home Assistant, it will now
ask you if you want to add a new Matter device or if you want to add a device
that is already added to another controller (like Google Home or Apple Home).

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/add-matter-device.png' alt='Screenshot showing the dialog to add a Matter device, asking if this is a new or existing matter device connected to another controller.'>

Suppose you choose to add a device that has already been added to another
controller. In that case, Home Assistant will guide you through how to
achieve this step by step.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/add-matter-device-from-another-controller.png' alt='Screenshot showing the dialog to add a existing Matter device that is connected to another Matter controller.'>

## Lock behavior improvements

Some smart locks have an open (or unlatching) mechanism that can be triggered
remotely. The door either pops out of the lock or can be opened by pushing
against the door.

We want to ensure you don't accidentally open the door when you miss-clicked
the button (for example, while not at home 😬). Therefore, we have improved
the behavior of locks in our user interface by requiring you to confirm the
action.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-04/lock-unlatch-confirmation.gif' alt='Screen recording showing the confirmation in the UI when unlatching/opening a door.'>

## Even more performance!

Remember how we wrote last release that [Home Assistant now boots twice as fast](/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/#home-assistant-boots-twice-as-fast)?
Well, [@bdraco] wasn't done yet and teamed up with [@balloob]. If you thought
the previous release was fast, you are in for a treat! 🚀 The difference is,
yet again, very noticeable.

Besides streamlining what is loaded at startup (and doing less loading), we
have adjusted the startup time tracking. It used to be that one integration
could push other integrations to be slow too; that should no longer be the case,
making this a more accurate representation of the actual startup time.

Want to learn about the individual startup times of your integrations? You can
find them in the {% my repairs title="**Settings** -> **System** -> **Repairs**" %}
page by selecting the tree-dotted menu in the top right and selecting the
**Integration startup time** item.

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Python 3.11 support has been removed" %}

Python 3.11 support has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.
Home Assistant now requires Python 3.12 to run.

You don’t have to do anything if you are using the Home Assistant Operating
System, Home Assistant Container, or Home Assistant Supervised installation
method. In those cases, we handle all of this for you. Your system has been
using Python 3.12 for quite some time already.

location: one provided daily weather forecasts and the other hourly forecasts.

The Met Office integration now only creates a single entity that provides both
daily and hourly weather forecasts.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

The Modbus integration does not allow a configuration with the device only
(no entities); this will create an issue, and the entry will not be loaded.

For the special cases (like some custom_components) where it is wanted,
please add a dummy entity.

{% details "MQTT" %}

Support for `brightness` is now assumed for `mqtt` lights with the `json` schema
unless only coelo modes `rgb`, `rgbw`, or `rgbww` are supported.

For light which only support  color modes `rgb`, `rgbw`, or `rgbww`, 
the `brightness` option flag can still be set to `false` if brightness is not
supported, in this case brightness support is emulated in Home Assistant by
scaling the RGBx-values.

For all other color modes except `ColorMode.ONOFF`, it is assumed brightness is
supported, and the `brightness` attribute will be included in the MQTT payload
when the `brightness` attribute is supplied to the `light.turn_on` service.

{% details "myUplink" %}

If you have a Nibe SMO 20 in your account, you will notice that some 550
entities are not provided by the integration.

You can safely remove these entities as the integration does not use them.

{% details "Waze Travel Time" %}

The options `excl_filter` and `incl_filter` now filter for exact matches to
street names in the route. Previously, they only filtered on the short
description of the route.

{% details "Weather" %}

The previously deprecated `forecast` attribute of weather entities, has now been
removed. Use the [`weather.get_forecasts`](/integrations/weather#service-weatherget_forecasts)
service to get the forecast data instead.
