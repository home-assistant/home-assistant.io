## Blueprint of the week
------

Are you one of those who always leave the doors open?

Then this week we have a nice blueprint for you! [BasTijs](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/bastijs )
has made a blueprint that announces through text-to-speech in the house,
that a door is open and only stops when the door is closed again.

## Sun card

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/AitorDB/home-assistant-sun-card" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-05-21-community-highlights/sun-card.png'
            alt="preview of the sun card"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:80%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

On our [Home Assistant reddit][reddit] page we also encountered another nice
project, namely that of [AitorDB](https://github.com/AitorDB). Who made a
[Lovelace card](https://github.com/AitorDB/home-assistant-sun-card) that shows
the position of the sun when it rises, is at its highest point and sets again.

## Collapsed card
------

Is your Lovelace dashboard overflowing with cards and do you want to
make some free space? Then try the card made by [RossMcMillan92](https://github.com/RossMcMillan92),
which makes it possible to collapse entire cards and reappear as a dropdown.

## Hyperion - HA bridge
------

You have those TVs where LEDs are mounted on the back so that the colors of
the TV continue over the wall behind it, this is also called ambilight. If
your TV is not equipped with this, you can also make this yourself through
the [Hyperion project](https://hyperion-project.org). [pimw](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/pimw)
has also written an [instruction post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/instruction-hyperion-ha-bridge-home-assistant/307708)
about this on our [community forum][community] on how to connect the bridge
to Home Assistant.
