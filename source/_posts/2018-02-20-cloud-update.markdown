We're happy to announce that the Home Assistant skill is now available in Canada, UK, Germany, India and Australia! Check it out in the [Amazon Alexa Skill store][alexa skill].

In the meanwhile, we have also been working on the Google Assistant integration. We passed the first verification and are now working with Google to do the final verification. Stay tuned!

In less than 2 weeks the open beta is about to expire. We're still working on setting up the company and payment system so we can start accepting payments. Until we do, Home Assistant Cloud will remain free.
