Home Assistant will join this year for [Hacktoberfest], an event organized by DigitalOcean and GitHub to support and celebrate open source. The idea is that open source projects like Home Assistant will gather a bunch of entry-level bugs, features and documentation enhancements and that you, a current or future contributor, will fix them. If you submit four pull-requests during the month of October you will have earned yourself a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt!

Why contribute to Home Assistant:

 - Written in Python3 with 94% test coverage
