<a href='/components/#version/0.65'><img src='/images/blog/2018-03-0.65/components.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

Release 0.65 has arrived and oh boy, is it awesome. First off, in case you have missed the previous release notes and [announcements](https://home-assistant.io/blog/2017/10/06/deprecating-python-3.4-support/): **Starting with this release, Home Assistant has dropped support for Python 3.4. The minimum supported version is now Python 3.5.3.** If you are on Hass.io or Docker, you'll automatically be running the latest and greatest. If you're on an older Hassbian installation or did your own Linux setup you'll need to upgrade to at least Python 3.5.3.

## {% linkable_title Naming entities %}

With the introduction of the entity registry in 0.63, Home Assistant is making sure that the same devices always receive the same entity IDs. This release is taking it a step further by allowing users to change the name of a device from the frontend. Changing the name will be instantly applied and overrides whatever name the device is given by the integration. If you want to switch back to the name from the integration, set the name to blank.

_This feature is, just like the entity registry, only available for integrations that provide unique IDs for their entities. Adding this to each integration is still a work in progress._

## {% linkable_title Filter sensor %}

The [filter sensor][sensor.filter docs] is a new 2nd order sensor by [@dgomes]: it will consume data from a sensor entity and apply filters to it. For the initial implementation it comes with Low-pass, Outlier and Throttle filters. Expect more to be added in the future.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: filter
    name: "filtered realistic humidity"
    entity_id: sensor.realistic_humidity
    filters:
      - filter: outlier
        window_size: 4
        radius: 4.0
      - filter: lowpass
        time_constant: 10
        precision: 2
```

    alt='Chart showing a humidity sensor with a lot of spikes and a smooth graph produced by the new filter sensor.'>

</p>

## {% linkable_title Light Group %}

We have had some discussion lately and realized that our current group component is very limiting. Extending it would probably lead to more confusion so we've decided to take a new approach: groups that are designed to be part of a specific component. The first one in this series comes at the hand of [@OttoWinter]: the group light ([docs][light.group docs]).

The group light creates a single light inside Home Assistant that is representing a group of lights. All commands will be forwarded and the state is a combination of all the lights.

```yaml
light:
  - platform: group
    name: Cool Light Group
    entities:
      - light.amazing_light
      - light.foobar
      - light.sun
```

## {% linkable_title HomeKit %}

HomeKit got some more upgrades. We've added support for temperature sensors in Fahrenheit, alarm systems, switches and thermostats. Just a few releases more and we should be able to cover it all.

## {% linkable_title Optional words for the Conversation component %}

The [conversation component](/components/conversation/) has always been a great introduction to controlling your house by voice. There is no hotword detection or powerful language engine behind it, but it gives a great intro to what is possible. Starting with this release, it will get a little bit more powerful with the introduction of optional words. To mark a word optional, wrap it in square brackets: `Change the light to [the color] {color}`.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
conversation:
  intents:
    LivingRoomTemperature:
     - What is the temperature in the living room
     - What is [the] living room temperature

intent_script:
  LivingRoomTemperature:
    speech:
      text: It is currently {{ states.sensor.temperature }} degrees in the living room.
```

## {% linkable_title Breaking Changes %}

- Insteon PLM: If you have created platform overrides in your configuration.yaml file to change a your INSTEON device to map to a different Home Assistant platform, that mapping will no longer be in effect. Please see the new device override capabilities in the [insteon_plm documentation](https://home-assistant.io/components/insteon_plm/). ([@teharris1] - [#12534]) ([insteon_plm docs]) ([binary_sensor.insteon_plm docs]) ([fan.insteon_plm docs]) ([light.insteon_plm docs]) ([sensor.insteon_plm docs]) ([switch.insteon_plm docs]) (breaking change)
- AirVisual's air index unit is AQI (Air Quality Index), not PSI (Pressure per Square Inch). ([@chilicheech] - [#12730]) ([sensor.airvisual docs]) (breaking change)
- TekSavvy Sensor: The sensor entity id for peak upload usage used to be `sensor.teksavvy_on_peak_upload_` this has been changed to `sensor.teksavvy_on_peak_upload`. The `usage` title was shared between and therefore indeterminate between GB and % usage. Therefore % usage entity ID has been changed to `sensor.teksavvy_usage_ratio` ([@mikeodr] - [#12325]) ([sensor.teksavvy docs]) (breaking change)
- Egardia redesign - generic component and sensor support ([@jeroenterheerdt] - [#11994]) ([egardia docs]) ([alarm_control_panel.egardia docs]) ([binary_sensor.egardia docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)
- zip_code for the Pollen integration is now required to have quotes around it to prevent accidental errors: `zip_code: "00544"` ([@bachya] - [#12934]) ([sensor.pollen docs]) (breaking change)
- Google Assistant integration: It is no longer possible to override the domain that Home Assistant uses for an entity. This was bound to go wrong when we would test supported features for different domains. Also removed support for disguising temperature sensors as thermostats. We should follow the traits that Google offer us and not offer things that will only work half. ([@balloob] - [#12959]) ([google_assistant docs]) ([light docs]) (breaking change)
- The LimitlessLED white temperature range has been adjusted and should now match the Mi-Light smartphone app for identical Kelvin values. ([@amelchio] - [#12971]) ([light.limitlessled docs]) (breaking change)
