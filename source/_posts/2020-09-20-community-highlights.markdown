It has been waaay too long since we had a Community Highlights blog.

Honestly, it is my fault. And then the [month of "What the heck?!"][mwth]
happened, and one of the raised WTH topics was:

> [Where are the ‚ÄúCommunity Highlights‚Äù?][wth]

Bas, and all the voters on that WTH topic, let's resolve that
WTH topic right now!

A nice way of closing our birthday week by showing some cool things our
community does while resolving a WTH. ü•≥

## A nice side project

OmegaX-NL shared a nice little project on our [subreddit][reddit], that really
fits the new style of working that many of us have to adapt too during this
pandemic.

It looks great, OmegaX-NL! Does it work for the kids?

## Illuminate your stairs

A regularly recurring project is the illumination of the stairs.
It can give a nice, futuristic touch to your home. Good illumination of the
steps also greatly improves safety.

Winter is coming, daylight will become shorter; it might be the time
to take care of some proper lights on the stairs outside.

[JayBigGuy] shared an [excellent blog article][smart-stairs] on building stairs
connecting his driveway with the deck, of course, full of smart lights.

  And this is the end result, nice job there Jay!

Jay was not the only one, [debsahu] added some lights to the deck steps as well!

## Thermostat with a wow factor

Thingsbeliketheydo shared probably one of the prettiest thermostats I've ever
seen. Using an old cell phone and a frame from the dollar store, he turned
Lovelace into a beautiful thermostat. ü§©
