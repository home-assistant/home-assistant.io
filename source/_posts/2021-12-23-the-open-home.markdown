The Open Home is our vision for the smart home. It defines the values that we put at the heart of every decision we make at Home Assistant. It's woven into our architecture, licensing, community and everything else.

The Open Home is about **privacy**, **choice** and **durability**.

_If you prefer video, skip [to the end](#state-of-the-open-home)._

## Privacy

Your home should be your safe space. A place where you can be your true self without having to bother about what the world thinks of you. A place where you don't need to act differently to avoid an algorithm categorizing your behavior.

**Privacy** for the Open Home means that devices need to work locally. You shouldn't need a cloud connection just to turn on a light bulb or change the thermostat.

It is okay for a product to offer a cloud connection, but it should be opt-in.

## Choice

Devices in your home gather data about themselves and their surroundings. Your data. Vendors shouldn't be able to limit access to your data or limit the interoperability of their products with the rest of your smart home.

**Choice** for the Open Home means that products need to make the gathered data available through local APIs. This avoids vendor lock-in and allows users to create their own smart home with products from different manufacturers.

## Durability

If there is one thing that technology firms are very good at, it is launching new products. However, maintaining the products and making sure they keep working is an afterthought for most. The result is that vendors will decide to turn off the support for your device, crippling the features or even prevent it from working at all. You will need to buy something new.

As we install more and more devices in our home, durability is becoming more and more important. We shouldn't have to buy everything new every couple of years because the manufacturer decided to move on and create something newer.

**Durability** for the Open Home means that devices are designed and built to keep working. Not just this year, but for the next decade.

## State of the Open Home

At the State of the Open Home, we presented this vision and how we, together with our friends from open source and academia, are working towards achieving it.
