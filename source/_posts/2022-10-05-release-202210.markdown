<a href='/integrations/#version/2022.10'><img src='/images/blog/2022-10/social.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

Happy October! October is always a special month for the project. It is the
month everybody starts working on their home automations again, the month that
Hacktoberfest brings in lots of new contributions and contributors to the
project (üëã welcome!), and also this year: [the Month of "What the Heck?!"](/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/).

The Month of WTH already [looks very promising](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/what-the-heck/56),
and many good and interesting issues, ideas, and suggestions to streamline
have been proposed. Keep those topics and votes going ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Oh! And Home Assistant Core 2022.10! üéâ

Last month's release was a big one; this month's release mostly continues to
improving on that. I guess it is no surprise that the biggest improvement can
be found (once again) in Bluetooth! There is a lot more, though this release
is a bit "all over the place", which is actually kinda nice.

Enjoy the release!

PS: I noticed the [Home Assistant SkyConnect is now available for pre-order](/skyconnect/) ü•≥

## Marcel van der Veldt joins Nabu Casa

We are excited to announce that [Marcel van der Veldt](https://github.com/marcelveldt)
has joined [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/)!

Marcel is known for his contributions to the [Z-Wave integration](/integrations/zwave_js),
the rewrite of the [Hue integration](/integrations/hue), the
[Music Assistant custom integration](https://github.com/music-assistant/hass-music-assistant),
and many more!

Marcel is going to be working on [Matter](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/)
support in Home Assistant. Just in case you missed it, Matter [is now officially
available/released](https://twitter.com/balloob/status/1576421490106384385) üéâ.

Welcome aboard Marcel!

## Active Bluetooth everywhere

Two releases back, we [introduced the Bluetooth integration](/blog/2022/08/03/release-20228/#first-class-bluetooth-support).
The previous release we brought Bluetooth everywhere in your home by adding
support for [Bluetooth Proxies](/blog/2022/09/07/release-20229/#bluetooth-everywhere).
Let's not stop there!

In this release, those proxies now support active Bluetooth connections! ü§Ø

To explain this quickly: Previously, we could listen for Bluetooth devices
and only receive data via the proxies (passive connection); now, we can actively
set up a conversation with those devices and send data (active connection). This
adds the capability to extend the range of Bluetooth devices that can be
controlled üíô.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-09/bluetooth-proxy-overview.png' alt='Picture of a home showing how Bluetooth data is proxied via ESPHome devices to Home Assistant'><br>

For this occasion, ESPHome will have an additional release, which adds this
functionality. We have also updated our [Bluetooth proxy installer website](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/)
to install with support for active connections.

So, you want to control that SwitchBot Bluetooth device on the other end of your
home that seems out of reach? Now you can by installing a proxy on
a simple ESP32 device.

Oh! Bonus: the Bluetooth performance has been improved too! Especially local
Bluetooth adapters should be quite a bit faster. üöÄ

## Support for iBeacons

This release also adds support for iBeacons. These are Bluetooth-enabled devices
that send out identifiers to announce their location. Home Assistant can
now pick those up and show an approximate distance to such an iBeacon.

iBeacons can open up a lot of awesome use cases for automations. For example,
you could attach an iBeacon to your car, so you'll know the car is at home. Or,
on the trash can and use it to determine if the garbage is still sitting in the
garage on pick-up day and send out a notification.

[Read more about iBeacons in our documentation](/integrations/ibeacon).

## Finding the right integration

Recently we [introduced "Supported brands"](/blog/2022/08/03/release-20228/#finding-the-integration-supporting-your-device),
allowing you to find integrations available under different brandings.
Now, we are taking it a step further streamlining the experience of adding new
devices or services.

For some brands of devices, we have multiple integrations available.
For example, we have a lot of "Google" integrations. Some brands provide devices
that can work via Zigbee or their matching hub, meaning you'd have a choice
of integrating their hub or using the devices directly via Zigbee
(e.g., using [ZHA](/integrations/zha)).

To make it more clear on the choices available, you can now categorize
integrations by brand. Home Assistant will show the options available
for that specific brand. For example, the "Google" brand:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-10/add-integration.png' alt='Screenshots showing adding an integration by the Google brands. Once you select Google, you will be offered all Google integrations'><br>

This way, you no longer have to "find out" how your device could be integrated.
We now show if an integration uses "the cloud" or not, so you are aware upfront.

We often get questions about YAML-only integrations that cannot be found in the
user interface. While we love them to be available via the UI, we can
understand not finding them at all can be confusing.

To help with that, we now show **all** integrations when adding a new
integration, including those only available via YAML. While they cannot be
set up via the user interface, we now do provide links to the documentation
with the instructions on how to set it up.

## Subviews for dashboards

This might be one of the coolest and most impactful features that has been
added to our Dashboards lately: Subviews!

Each view on a dashboard can now be marked as being a "Subview":

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-10/subview-toggle.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new subview toggle in the view options'><br>

Subviews won't show up in the navigation bar of your dashboard, meaning
you can only navigate to them by using, for example, a navigation action on
a button.

When you navigate to a subview, the subview itself will not show the Dashboard
navigation bar. Instead, it will show a back button to the previous view
you came from.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-10/subview-navigation.gif' alt='Screen recording showing a Kitchen subview in action'>
Screen recording showing a Kitchen subview in action.
</p>

This allows for creating cool navigation concepts that are particularly helpful
on a mobile or tablet device.

## All dialogs restyled

All dialogs that are shown in the Home Assistant have been slightly updated.

Most notably: The dialogs are now rounder on the edges, and the action buttons
have been styled and named more consistently. It brings Home Assistant closer
to version 3 of the Material Design that Home Assistant follows.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-10/new-dialogs.png' alt='Screenshot showing one of the restyled dialogs.'><br>

## Viewing YAML automations in the automation editor

In the last release, we revamped our automation editor, and we are very
happy to read how many of you loved these changes ‚ù§Ô∏è

However, if you manage your automations manually in YAML, you'd always be
served an error message when trying to open an automation in the UI. Not very
helpful, right?

This has been improved! You can now open **any** automation (or script) in the
UI. This lets you view your automation, providing a quick glance at its
workings.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-10/yaml-automation-editor.png' alt='Screenshot showing an YAML automation as read-only in the automation editor.'><br>

Besides, as a bonus, if you have considered moving your automation to the UI,
you can now view and experience how it would look/work for those automations
and import them into the UI with the click of a button in the top right.

## Handling version numbers in templates

A new `version()` template function/filter has been added, allowing you to do
awesome things with version numbers in templates.

It allows for getting information about a version number, comparing version
numbers, and even checking the difference between two versions.

{% raw %}

- `{{ version("2022.10.0") > "2022.9.7" }}`  
  Returns true, as `2022.10.0` is newer.

- `{{ (version("2022.10.1") - "2022.10.0").patch }}`  
  Returns true, as the patch number of the version changed.

- `{{ (version("2022.10.1") - "2022.10.0").minor }}`  
  Returns false, as there is just a patch difference.

- `{{ version("2022.10.0b0").beta }}`  
  Return true, as this is a beta version.

{% endraw %}

`version()` can be helpful when building automations or Blueprints for
[update](/integrations/update) entities. You could, for example, easier
decide to automatically upgrade or send more detailed notification messages
in case a patch version is available.

## Google Sheets

This release introduces a new way to export data from Home Assistant:
**[Google Sheets]**.

With this integration, you can add new rows to a Google Sheet document
from a service call, allowing you to export data from automations for
further processing, visualization, or insights.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-10/google-sheets.png' alt='Screenshots exporting energy data to Google Sheets from Home Assistant'>
Export anything you like to a sheet in Google Sheets, like your energy usage.
</p>

Maybe you like to export your daily energy usage or keep track of the number
of diapers you have used in your baby feeding diary spreadsheet.

The possibilities with this are endless.

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- The long-term statics card now uses the unit you have selected a sensor to
  be in. So, if you've changed the sensor, it will now match! Also, more sensors
  are now able to change/convert units. Thanks, [@emontnemery] and [@epenet]!
- When removing integrations that use application credentials, we will now ask
  if you want to clean up those credentials. Nice touch, [@allenporter]!
- The [Netatmo] integration got lots of love! It now supports the Netatmo
  Doorbell, modulating thermostats and now also supports devices from Legrand,
  Bubendorff, BTicino and Smarther! Thank you [@cgtobi]!
- If you have a Prusa printer, you can now use the [PrusaLink] integration
  to control your print job using the new job control buttons available!
  Thanks, [@balloob]!
- [BTHome] now supports binary sensors! Thanks, [@Ernst79]!
- The [HomeKit Controller] now supports [Thread] transport. Thanks, [@roysjosh]
  and [@Jc2k]!
- [forked-daapd] (OwnTone) now supports the media browser and can leverage
  the Spotify integration. Thanks, [@uvjustin]!
- The [Min/Max] helper now supports calculating the statistical range. For
  example, helpful if you want to show the difference between the coolest and
  warmest rooms. Thanks, [@jsherman256]!
- [@holysoles] added unique ID support to the [Universal Media Player],
  [@magic7s] added support for it to [OhmConnect]. Thanks!
- [NETGEAR] now has a bunch of switches to control things like parental
  controls, Wi-Fi availability, and access. Thanks, [@starkillerOG]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Bayesian" %}

`prob_given_false` is now a required configuration variable. Previously it had a default value of `1 - prob_given_true`; this didn't really have any mathematical basis and so has been removed. You can use this documentation to calculate what it should be, or to restore your previous functionality, set it to `1 - prob_given_true`.

The logic of Bayesian sensors has been significantly corrected. Previously the configs given in the examples above would not have worked as expected. For example, if the device `device_tracker.paulus` was `home`, this would not have updated the probability that `Paulus Home` was on. This is because Bayesian ignored observations that were false, even though that *should* update our probabilities. 

Because of this, many users will have had to use either of two workarounds:

1. Providing additional observations that evaluate to `True` when the other evaluates to `False`, effectively mirroring it. This forced Bayesian to take into account a negative observation.
2. Tweaking `prior`, `threshold`, and even sometimes `prob_given_true` and `prob_given_false` to get the desired functionality, often with the help of a community-provided spreadsheet for iterative testing.

To solve (1), all you need do is delete the mirrored entry as shown below:

```yaml
# Example of a mirrored entry used a workaround
binary_sensor:
  - name: "Heat On"
    platform: bayesian
    prior: 0.2
    probability_threshold: 0.9
    observations:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.outside_air_temperature_fahrenheit
        prob_given_true: 0.95
        prob_given_false: 0.05
        below: 50
      - platform: numeric_state # line no longer needed - delete
        entity_id: sensor.outside_air_temperature_fahrenheit # line no longer needed - delete
        prob_given_true: 0.05 # line no longer needed - delete
        prob_given_false: 0.95 # line no longer needed - delete
        above: 50 # no longer needed - delete
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.house_occupied
        prob_given_true: 0.3
        prob_given_false: 0.05
        to_state: "on"
      - platform: state # line no longer needed - delete
        entity_id: binary_sensor.house_occupied # line no longer needed - delete
        prob_given_true: 0.7 # line no longer needed - delete
        prob_given_false: 0.95 # line no longer needed - delete
        to_state: "off" # line no longer needed - delete
```

To solve (2), you need to re-estimate your probabilities using this documentation - this will likely result in better performance in the long term.

A hacky and *not recommended* workaround to restore your previous functionality would be to put in a mirrored entry for each observation where `prob_given_false` is equal to `prob_given_true`. This will induce the same behavior as before - the negative, counterfactual observation is essentially ignored. Be warned - this may break or cause errors in future versions and will not work for `template` or `numeric_state` observations. For templates, instead, make them return `None` where they would have returned `False` to induce Bayesian to ignore them.

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - name: "Heat On"
    platform: bayesian
    prior: 0.2
    probability_threshold: 0.9
    observations:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.house_occupied
        prob_given_true: 0.3
        prob_given_false: 0.05
        to_state: "on"
      - platform: state # not 
        entity_id: binary_sensor.house_occupied # not recommended
        prob_given_true: 0.5 # not recommended
        prob_given_false: 0.5 # not recommended
        to_state: "off" # not recommended
```

Movie names are no longer included as attributes in the movies sensor. Upcoming
has been removed. It is being modernized as calendar items should be.
Diskspace is now split into different sensors, one for each folder.
Status and commands have been removed as they don't appear to have real
value for automations.

{% details "Workday" %}

Due to changes in the upstream library, the following is no longer supported by
the Workday integration:
- UK subdivisions (Wales, Scotland, England...) can no longer be provided as
  values to the `country` configuration key. They are still available for use as
  values to the `province` setting.
- `IsleOfMan` is no longer a recognized province of the UK,
  use the `IM` code for the `country` instead.
- The extended Portuguese holiday set (`PortugalExt`) is no longer available
  as a separate country; instead you should use the country code `PT` and
  the province `Ext`.
