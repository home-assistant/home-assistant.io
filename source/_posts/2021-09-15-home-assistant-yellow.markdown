_This project was originally published under the name Home Assistant Amber._

To celebrate our 8th birthday we're launching a crowdfunding campaign for Home Assistant Yellow. We designed Home Assistant Yellow from scratch for both beginners and home automation enthusiasts
to be the easiest way to run Home Assistant.

We will be hosting a Home Assistant Yellow live stream today at 12.00 PDT / 21.00 CEST. We will talk about how Home Assistant Yellow came to be and answer any questions you might have!
