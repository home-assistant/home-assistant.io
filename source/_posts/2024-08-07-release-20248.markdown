**Welcome to the beta release notes for Home Assistant 2024.8** üéâ

<br />

Please note that these release notes are a work in progress. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We will be
completing them over the next couple of days. Not all features might be final
yet, and some features _**may not** make it into the final release_.

<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.
You can find our issue trackers and the reported issues during beta here:

<br />

- [Report(ed) beta **dashboards/UI/frontend** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/milestone/121)
- [Report(ed) beta **integrations/automations/backend/core** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/milestone/680)
- [Report(ed) beta **documentation** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/milestone/129)

üôè When reporting issues, **make sure to mention the exact beta version you are
running** in the issue description. This will help us identify and track the
issue correctly. Read more about [reporting issues here](/help/reporting_issues/).

<br />

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority. üîù

Home Assistant 2024.8! üéâ

Enjoy the (beta) release!

It is not just new {% term integrations %} that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:

- The **[Lorem]** integration now provides ipsum entities that allow you to
  configure the behavior of your Slipsum, thanks [@frenck]!

### Integrations reaching platinum quality level

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "MQTT" %}

The `schema` option has been removed from the mqtt vacuum schema. YAML configs
still containing this option will break after 6 months of deprecation. Users
have been warned with with a repair. Discovery configs will not break if the
schema options is still in the config, but it will simple be ignored and an
error message will be logged to notice.

([@jbouwh] - [#121093]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#121093]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121093

- Remove schema option for mqtt vacuum configs ([@jbouwh] - [#121093]) ([mqtt docs]) (breaking-change)
