{% note %}

**Welcome to the beta release notes for Home Assistant 2024.8** üéâ

<br />

Please note that these release notes are a work in progress. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We will be
completing them over the next couple of days. Not all features might be final
yet, and some features _**may not** make it into the final release_.

<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.
You can find our issue trackers and the reported issues during beta here:

<br />

- [Report(ed) beta **dashboards/UI/frontend** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/milestone/122)
- [Report(ed) beta **integrations/automations/backend/core** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/milestone/680)
- [Report(ed) beta **documentation** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/milestone/129)

üôè When reporting issues, **make sure to mention the exact beta version you are
running** in the issue description. This will help us identify and track the
issue correctly. Read more about [reporting issues here](/help/reporting_issues/).

<br />

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority. üîù

## Dashboards - Chapter 2

As part of our [roadmap](/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards), work has
continued, making the dashboard customization and organization easier and more
intuitive.

Last week, we had the ["Dashboards Chapter 2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o)
live stream, talking about the current state of the dashboards, the progress
we have made, the upcoming features and improvements we are working on, but
more importantly: Great insights in all the research and design philosophy
behind the dashboards. In case you missed it, you can watch the recording
on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o) or
read the [recap blog post](/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/).

As part of our continuous improvement: This month we have fully redesigned
and revamped the badges for your dashboards!

### New badges for your dashboard

We already wrote about it extensively in our [Dashboard Chapter 2 blog post](/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#new-badges):
this release introduces our redesigned badges!

A big revamp of the original badges that have been in Home Assistant since, well,
forever. The new badges are designed to match the design of the
[Mushroom] chip cards, and are
mean to sit at the top of a dashboard view, providing a summary of the most
important information that you need to know, at a glance.

<img src="/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png" alt="New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!">

These new badges are of course fully configurable from the UI, allowing you to
fully tweak them to your needs. You can specify whether the icon, name, and/or
state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within each of them.

Everything can, of course, be dragged and dropped in the order you like üòé

Not just that, the new badges also come with visibility options, the same
as we have [introduced for cards in Home Assistant 2024.6](/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards).
Meaning you can show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what
screen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state, and more.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/badges-add-visibility.png" alt="Screenshots; left showing the add badge dialog wich include the custom mushroom template badge, on the right shows the visibility tab and options badges now have.">

The best news of all? The new badges work across both the new sections view and
the old masonry view! üéâ Heck!, we even support for custom badges, like the
custom template one released by the [Mushroom] project üçÑ.

If you have existing old-style badges today, don't worry! They will be
automatically converted to the new badges when you upgrade to this release.

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Recorder database upgrade notice" %}

This notice is only relevant if you are using the recorder integration with
an MySQL or ProgreSQL database. If you are using the default SQLite database,
you can ignore this notice.

This release includes a database upgrade/migration that increases the size
of the number we can store for the idenfier fields. A more technical explanation:
We are upgrading integer fields for ID columns from a 32-bit integer to `BIGINT`,
which is a 64-bit integer.

This can cause the database upgrade to take longer than usual, depending on
the size of your database.

Please be patient and let the upgrade process finish. Do not interrupt the
upgrade process, as this can lead to a corrupted database.

[#121093]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121093

{% enddetails %}

{% details "BlinkStick" %}

The Blinksticklight integration is disabled because it requires software that
is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcomed.

([@joostlek] - [#121846]) ([documentation](/integrations/blinksticklight))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#121846]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121846

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Bluesound" %}

Sources behave slightly different. Radio station providers (like TuneIn, Radio
Paradise) are not part of the source list anymore as they are not selectable
as source.

Presets which play a specific radio station can be created in the BluOS app and
are displayed as sources in Home Assistant.

The currently selected source tries to match those presets and falls back to
the radio station provider (like TuneIn, Radio Paradise).

[@LouisChrist]: https://github.com/LouisChrist
[#117257]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117257

{% enddetails %}

{% details "BMW Connected Drive" %}

Describing attributes `car` and `vin` have been removed from BMW entities.
If you need to look them up, please get them from the device info screen.

([@rikroe] - [#120830]) ([documentation](/integrations/bmw_connected_drive))

[@rikroe]: https://github.com/rikroe
[#121093]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/120830

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Climate" %}

Scenes that used the deprecated auxiliary heat (`aux_heat` attribute),
will no longer restore/set the auxiliary heat state when the scene
is activated.

([@bjpetit] - [#121873]) ([documentation](/integrations/climate))

[@bjpetit]: https://github.com/bjpetit
[#121873]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121873

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Concord232" %}

The Concord232 integration is disabled because it requires software that
is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcomed.

([@joostlek] - [#121974]) ([documentation](/integrations/concord232))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#121974]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121974

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DoorBird" %}

Previously resetting the device favorites required working out a complicated
URL. A button is now available to perform this operation.

([@bdraco] - [#121720]) ([documentation](/integrations/doorbird))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#121720]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121720

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Dovado" %}

The Dovado integration is disabled because it requires software that
is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcomed.

([@joostlek] - [#121871]) ([documentation](/integrations/dovado))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#121871]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121871

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit Bridge" %}

PM2.5 airquality sensors are now mapped to the [US EPA AQI scale](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-02/pm-naaqs-air-quality-index-fact-sheet.pdf).
The new cutoff value for US AQI Good (0-50) is 9.0 ¬µg/m3 is thus now used to
match the 2024 US EPA AQI standard.

([@sarabveer] - [#121093]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@sarabveer]: https://github.com/sarabveer
[#109900]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109900

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Lights" %}

The following attributes are no longer saved in the database for light
entities because their combinations would quickly fill up the database and
they are never used by Home Assistant:

- `brightness`
- `color_mode`
- `color_temp`
- `color_temp_kelvin`
- `effect`
- `hs_color`
- `rgb_color`
- `rgbw_color`
- `rgbww_color`
- `xy_color`

This change has no impact on the operation of your lights, but it will reduce
the amount of data stored in the database.

([@bdraco] - [#121776]) ([documentation](/integrations/light))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#121776]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121776

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Matter" %}

Multi press events are now split of into their own dedicated event type such as
`multi_press_1`, `multi_press_2` etc. making it easier to automate on multiple
presses instead of having to look manually at the number of presses count.

If you have used the current event type in your automations, you will need to
update them to use the new event types.

([@marcelveldt] - [#122191]) ([documentation](/integrations/matter))

[@marcelveldt]: https://github.com/marcelveldt
[#122191]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/122191

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

The `schema` option has been removed from the mqtt vacuum schema. YAML configs
still containing this option will break after 6 months of deprecation. Users
have been warned with with a repair. Discovery configs will not break if the
schema options is still in the config, but it will simple be ignored and an
error message will be logged to notice.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MVG" %}

([@joostlek] - [#121975]) ([documentation](/integrations/mvglive))

The MVG integration is disabled because it requires software that
is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcomed.

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#121975]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121975

{% enddetails %}

{% details "National Weather Service (NWS)" %}

NWS weather entities no longer have a `detailed_description` in the return
from the `weather.get_forecasts` service.

A new service, `nws.get_forecasts_extra`, is provided that includes
`detailed_description`. The `detailed_description` is no longer provided
for `hourly` forecasts in the `nws.get_forecasts_extra` service as the API
does not return data, however a `short_description` is now available.

[@MatthewFlamm]: https://github.com/MatthewFlamm
[#117254]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117254

{% enddetails %}

{% details "NextBus" %}

The `messages`, `directions`, and `attribution` attributes have been removed from
the sensor. The new API doesn't provide these anymore.

[@ViViDboarder]: https://github.com/ViViDboarder
[#121133]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121133

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenAI Conversation" %}

The previously deprecated `256`, `512`, and `1024` values for size argument for
the `generate_image` service have been removed. They have already been
unsupported in the past (replaced with `1024x1024` by default).

If you still use these values in your automations or scripts, you will need to
update them to use "1024x1024", "1024x1792", or "1792x1024" values.

[#122388]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/122388

{% enddetails %}

{% details "WLED" %}

The WLED integration now requires a WLED device running at least
[WLED 0.14.0](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/releases/tag/v0.14.0)

[#122101]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/122101

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Xiaomi Miio" %}

The `Nature` and `Normal` preset modes will be renamed to `nature`
and `normal` to support translations.

If you have automations or scripts that use the `Nature` or `Normal` preset
modes, you will need to update them to use `nature` and `normal` instead.
