## Dashboards - Chapter 2

As part of our [roadmap](/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards), work has
continued, making the dashboard customization and organization easier and more
intuitive.

Last week, we had the ["Dashboards Chapter 2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o)
live stream, talking about the current state of the dashboards, the progress
we have made, the upcoming features and improvements we are working on, but
more importantly: Great insights in all the research and design philosophy
behind the dashboards. In case you missed it, you can watch the recording
on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o) or
read the [recap blog post](/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/).

As part of our continuous improvement: This month we have fully redesigned
and revamped the badges for your dashboards!

### New badges for your dashboard

We already wrote about it extensively in our [Dashboard Chapter 2 blog post](/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#new-badges):
this release introduces our redesigned badges!

A big revamp of the original badges that have been in Home Assistant since, well,
forever. The new badges are designed to match the design of the
[Mushroom] chip cards, and are
mean to sit at the top of a dashboard view, providing a summary of the most
important information that you need to know, at a glance.

<img src="/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png" alt="New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!">

These new badges are of course fully configurable from the UI, allowing you to
fully tweak them to your needs. You can specify whether the icon, name, and/or
state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within each of them.

Everything can, of course, be dragged and dropped in the order you like üòé

Not just that, the new badges also come with visibility options, the same
as we have [introduced for cards in Home Assistant 2024.6](/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards).
Meaning you can show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what
screen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state, and more.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/badges-add-visibility.png" alt="Screenshots; left showing the add badge dialog wich include the custom mushroom template badge, on the right shows the visibility tab and options badges now have.">

The best news of all? The new badges work across both the new sections view and
the old masonry view! üéâ Heck!, we even support for custom badges, like the
custom template one released by the [Mushroom] project üçÑ.

If you have existing old-style badges today, don't worry! They will be
automatically converted to the new badges when you upgrade to this release.

## Goodbye service calls, hello actions üëã

This release marks an important milestone in the evolution of Home Assistant:
we are saying goodbye to **service calls** and hello to **actions**!

If you are a long-time user of Home Assistant reading this now: don't be alarmed
by this change, nothing breaks with this, and everything will continue to work
as you are used to.

In the 2024.1 release, we [unified the actions](/2024/01/03/release-20241/#unified-actions)
in the Home Assistant automation & script editors. The goal of that change
was to make our automation editor easier to understand for newer users, by
removing the "Service call" layer and terminology.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.">

The UI in above screenshot is thus already in place since the January release,
and was very well received in general. However, the underlying terminology
in our documentation and all other places in Home Assistant was still using
the "service call" terminology.

Additionally, the term "services" in Home Assistant is overloaded and abiguous.
It is used for both the services you can call in Home Assistant, but also for
service you might integrate with, like a weather service, or a music service.
In the latter case, we are talking about integrating with a service provided by
a software program or website, the menu item in the setting called
**Devices & services** that refers to that. üòµ‚Äçüí´

To make things more clear, we are now changing the terminology in Home Assistant
from "services" (as in service calls variant) to "actions" **everywhere**.

Every occurance in the documentation, the UI, the code, and everywhere else
in Home Assistant, has been replaced with "action". Unlike the previous services
which where "called", actions are "performed".

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/actions-developers-tools.png" alt="Screenshot of the developers tools, which also renamed all occurances of services to actions.">

{% important %}

If you are writing automations in YAML, you will notice that the `service` key
in your actions is now called `action`. For example:

```yaml
- action: light.turn_on
  target:
    area: living_room
```

Existing UI-managed automations will be automatically converted to when they
are edited and saved the next time. If you write automation in YAML, you can
use either `action` or `service` as this change is fully backward compatible,
but we recommend using `action` from now on.

{% endimportant %}

## Sort data tables by created or last modified

You've added a new integration, a new device, or maybe just updated
Home Assistant and wondering what new entities or devices you have available?

This release is going to help you with that. Home Assistant now tracks
when entities, devices, and many other things were created or last
modified. If these are shown in a table, it means you can now sort them by
the date they were created or last modified; helping you finding those
recently added or modified items.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/data-tables-created-modified-columns-sorting.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new created and modified columns of the entities table, allowing one to sort on these new values.">

The created and modified columns are hidden by default, but you can make them
visible by clicking the {% icon "mdi:cog" %} icon in the top right of the
table. Sorting is always available, regardless of the visibility of the columns.

## Control Home Assistant using AI with Ollama

In the 2024.6 release, we introduced the ability to use the [OpenAI] and
[GoogleAI] {%term integrations %} to [control your home using Large Language Models]
(LLMs). Many of you request this to work with a local hosted LLM as well.

Today we are happy to announce that Home Assistant now supports being
controlled by local LLMs too!

This is achieved thanks to [@Shulyaka] adding support for the brand new tools
API in Ollama. The performance of the local models has been fine tuned by
[@AllenPorter].

Allen created a new LLM benchmark suite that is more balanced and less focused
on the edge cases. We scored the different models with this new benchmark.

The cloud-based models scored 98% on this new benchmark while local LLMs did
not do so well. Through prompt tuning and fixes included in this release,
we have been able to now get local LLMs to be able to score a reasonable 81%.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/llama-3.1-iteration.png" alt="Graph showing the iteration progress of implementing local Ollama support using the Llama 3.1 8B model.">

We will continue to work on testing new models and improving our prompts
and tools to achieve a higher score.

If you like to experiment with local LLMs using Home Assistant, we currently
recommend using the Llama 3.1 8B model.

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Bluesound]**, done by [@LouisChrist]
- **[Genius Hub]**, done by [@GeoffAtHome]
- **[History stats]**, done by [@gjohansson-ST]
- **[Mastodon]**, done by [@andrew-codechimp]

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **UE Smart Radio** has been removed, the service has been [discontinued](https://forums.slimdevices.com/forum/user-forums/general-discussion/1668327-uesmartradio-com-and-mysqueezebox-com-servers).

## Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) updates

The [Zigbee Home Automation] (ZHA) integration has seen lot of improvements
and love from [@dmulcahey], [@puddly], and [@TheJulianJES] this release.

What this means for you? Well... basically nothing! And this sounds odd, but is
is a good thing!

The whole integration has been split into a separate codebases, making it
easier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration
that took months of work to get done.

You will not notice anything different right now, but this change will make
it easier to maintain and improve the integration in the future, including
the ability for code contributers to contribute to the integration more easily.

![Chart showing how ZHA dropping from the number one integration in terms of lines of code to about number ten](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/assets/32534428/d708f61b-1746-4306-9264-24b7ad2ec40a)

## Matter updates

A couple of updates for the Matter integration this release, while we are
working hard to get the integration ready for official Matter certification.

The Matter integration can now provide update entities. Meaning, if your
Matter device has a firmware update available, Home Assistant will now
be able to inform you about it and update the device for you. üéâ

_TODO: Add screenshot of a Matter device updating_

This update feature is available for all Matter devices of which the
manufacturers provide firmware updates for via the official main Matter update
channels. There are not many manufacturers yet, but this is a great step
forward and we hope many Matter manufacturers will follow this example.

Event entities provided by the Matter integration have been improved. They
will now provide more event types, allowing you to react to things like single
press or double press events with ease.

Additionally, [@jvmahon] contributed support for select entities to the Matter
integration. This is used for selecting modes if your Matter device supports
that. For example, laundry washer, oven or dishwasher modes.

[@jvmahon]: https://github.com/jvmahon

## KNX can now be managed via the UI

_TODO: Add piece of text / story / context as provided by [@farmio]_

The [KNX integration] now supports managing entities from the UI. This means
you can now create, update, and delete KNX entities directly from the UI
in the brand new dedicated KNX panel.

<img src="/images/blog/2024-08/knx-panel-for-creating-entities.png" alt="Screenshot showing the brand new KNX panel that allows you to manage the entities created by KNX right from the UI.">

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- It is now possible to ipsum the lorem, thanks [@frenck]!

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck

{% details "Potential changes to process" icon="mdi:scale-balance" %}

- Add support for the Select platform in Matter ([@jvmahon] - [#119769]) ([matter docs]) (new-platform)

{% enddetails %}

## Integrations and helpers set up via YAML, now visible in the UI!

Most popular {% term integrations %} and helpers can be set up directly from the
Home Assistant user interface. However, we still have a lot of older or less
used integrations that can only be set up using manual YAML configuration.

We are working hard to move more and more of these integrations to the UI,
however, this takes time and effort; every release we are enabling more and
more of these integrations to be set up from the UI.

The problem with these integrations is that they are not visible in the UI
when they are set up using YAML. What we often see happening, is that someone
set up an integration using YAML, and next cannot see them on the integrations
page. Often resulting in questions in our community about where to find them.

As of this release, we have drasticly improved this situation. All integrations,
regardless of how they are set up, are now visible in the integrations page
in the UI. This means that even if you set up an integration using YAML, you
can now find them in the UI and can view their provided entities.

![CleanShot 2024-07-22 at 08 58 53](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcdb16db-cfec-4490-928c-7e5486a746de)

_TODO: Replace screenshot_

Integrations originating from manual YAML configuration can be recognized by the
{% icon "mdi:code-braces" %} icon showing on their cards.

Similar, we also have a lot of helpers that can only be set up using YAML
configuration. These sometimes showed up in the UI, but often did not. We have
adjusted this as well, and made sure that all helpers are now visible in the UI,
regardless how they are set up.

{% note %}
Things set up manually using YAML are still managed using YAML. This means that
if you want to change the configuration of these integrations or helpers, you
will need to do so in the YAML configuration files.
{% endnote %}

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Recorder database upgrade notice" %}

This notice is only relevant if you are using the recorder integration with
an MySQL or ProgreSQL database. If you are using the default SQLite database,
you can ignore this notice.

This release includes a database upgrade/migration that increases the size
of the number we can store for the idenfier fields. A more technical explanation:
We are upgrading integer fields for ID columns from a 32-bit integer to `BIGINT`,
which is a 64-bit integer.

This can cause the database upgrade to take longer than usual, depending on
the size of your database.

Please be patient and let the upgrade process finish. Do not interrupt the
upgrade process, as this can lead to a corrupted database.

{% details "Bluesound" %}

Sources behave slightly different. Radio station providers (like TuneIn, Radio
Paradise) are not part of the source list anymore as they are not selectable
as source.

Presets which play a specific radio station can be created in the BluOS app and
are displayed as sources in Home Assistant.

The currently selected source tries to match those presets and falls back to
the radio station provider (like TuneIn, Radio Paradise).

{% details "Lights" %}

The following attributes are no longer saved in the database for light
entities because their combinations would quickly fill up the database and
they are never used by Home Assistant:

- `brightness`
- `color_mode`
- `color_temp`
- `color_temp_kelvin`
- `effect`
- `hs_color`
- `rgb_color`
- `rgbw_color`
- `rgbww_color`
- `xy_color`

This change has no impact on the operation of your lights, but it will reduce
the amount of data stored in the database.

{% details "Matter" %}

Multi press events are now split of into their own dedicated event type such as
`multi_press_1`, `multi_press_2` etc. making it easier to automate on multiple
presses instead of having to look manually at the number of presses count.

If you have used the current event type in your automations, you will need to
update them to use the new event types.

{% details "MQTT" %}

The `schema` option has been removed from the mqtt vacuum schema. YAML configs
still containing this option will break after 6 months of deprecation. Users
have been warned with with a repair. Discovery configs will not break if the
schema options is still in the config, but it will simple be ignored and an
error message will be logged to notice.

{% details "MVG" %}

([@joostlek] - [#121975]) ([documentation](/integrations/mvglive))

The MVG integration is disabled because it requires software that
is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcomed.

{% details "National Weather Service (NWS)" %}

NWS weather entities no longer have a `detailed_description` in the return
from the `weather.get_forecasts` service.

A new service, `nws.get_forecasts_extra`, is provided that includes
`detailed_description`. The `detailed_description` is no longer provided
for `hourly` forecasts in the `nws.get_forecasts_extra` service as the API
does not return data, however a `short_description` is now available.

{% details "NextBus" %}

the sensor. The new API doesn't provide these anymore.

{% details "OpenAI Conversation" %}

The previously deprecated `256`, `512`, and `1024` values for size argument for
the `generate_image` service have been removed. They have already been
unsupported in the past (replaced with `1024x1024` by default).

If you still use these values in your automations or scripts, you will need to
update them to use "1024x1024", "1024x1792", or "1792x1024" values.

{% details "Xiaomi Miio" %}

The `Nature` and `Normal` preset modes will be renamed to `nature`
and `normal` to support translations.

If you have automations or scripts that use the `Nature` or `Normal` preset
modes, you will need to update them to use `nature` and `normal` instead.
