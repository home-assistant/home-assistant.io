## Dashboards - Chapter 2

As part of our [roadmap](/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/#dashboards), work has
continued on making dashboard customization and organization easier and more
intuitive.

Last week, we had the ["Dashboards Chapter 2"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o)
live stream, talking about the current state of the dashboards, the progress
we have made, the upcoming features, and improvements we are working on, but
more importantly: The great insights in all our research and the design philosophy
behind the dashboards. In case you missed it, you can watch the 1-hour recording
on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmXLxQPr1o) or
read the [recap blog post](/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/).

As part of our continuous improvement, this month we have fully redesigned
and revamped the badges for your dashboards!

### New badges for your dashboard

We already wrote about it extensively in our [Dashboard Chapter 2 blog post](/blog/2024/07/26/dashboard-chapter-2/#new-badges)
and this release introduces our redesigned badges!

This is a big revamp of the original badges that have been in Home Assistant
since, well, forever. The new badges are designed to match the design of the
[Mushroom] chip cards, and are meant to sit at the top of a dashboard view,
providing a summary of the most important information that you need to know
at a glance.

<img src="/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png" alt="New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!">

These new badges match the functionality of the previous designm but are
now even more feature-rich. Of course, they are fully configurable from the UI,
allowing you to tweak them to your needs. You can specify whether the icon,
name, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within
each of them.

Everything can, of course, be dragged and dropped in the order you like üòé

Not just that, the new badges also come with visibility options, the same
as we have [introduced for cards in Home Assistant 2024.6](/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#control-visibility-of-cards).
This means you can show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what
screen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state,
and more.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/badges-add-visibility.png" alt="Screenshots; left showing the add badge dialog wich include the custom mushroom template badge, on the right shows the visibility tab and options badges now have.">

The best news of all? The new badges work across both the new sections view and
the old masonry view! üéâ Heck!, we even have support for custom badges, like the
custom template one released by the [Mushroom] project üçÑ.

If you have existing old-style badges today, don't worry! They will be
automatically converted to the new badges when you upgrade to this release.

### Picture cards get image from the person entity

Remember when changing a person picture and picture cards did not reflect the brand new image ?

That's now an old story, picture cards can now fetch your person picture, so you don't have to update them manually !

__Example on `picture-glance` card__

- Before: it uses a static image

```yaml
type: picture-glance
entity: person.paulus
image: /api/image/serve/a52be54b0cefa35bf27abac3b2a3df1a/512x512
entities:
 - weather.paris
```

- After: it retrieves the image from the person entity automatically

```yaml
type: picture-glance
entity: person.paulus
image_entity: person.paulus
entities:
 - weather.lyon
```

The result is the same, until you change Paulus's picture and you see that with the `image` attribute, the card is keeping the previous picture.

Thanks [@Quentame]

## Goodbye service calls, hello actions üëã

This release marks an important milestone in the evolution of Home Assistant:
we are saying goodbye to **service calls** and hello to **actions**!

If you are a long-time user of Home Assistant reading this now: don't be alarmed
by this change, nothing breaks with this, and everything will continue to work
just as it did before.

In the 2024.1 release, we [unified the actions](/2024/01/03/release-20241/#unified-actions)
in the Home Assistant {% term automation %} & script editors. The goal of
that change was to make our automation editor easier for newer users to
understand by removing the ‚ÄúService call‚Äù layer and terminology.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-01/add-action-search.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new add action dialog utilizing the search function to find whatever you need.">

The above screenshot shows the UI that has been in use since the [January release](/2024/01/03/release-20241/),
and was very well received in general. However, the underlying terminology
in our documentation and all other places in Home Assistant still used the
"service call" terminology.

Additionally, the term "services" in Home Assistant is overloaded and ambiguous.
It is used for both the services you can call in Home Assistant and services you
might integrate with, like weather or music services. In the latter case, we
are talking about integrating with a service provided by a program or website,
which is referenced in our Settings page as **Devices & services**. üòµ‚Äçüí´

To make things more clear, we are now changing the terminology around
_service calls_ in Home Assistant from "services" to "actions" **everywhere**.

Every occurrence in the documentation, the UI, the code, and everywhere else
in Home Assistant, has been replaced with "action". Unlike the previous services
which were "called", actions are "performed".

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/actions-developers-tools.png" alt="Screenshot of the developers tools, which also renamed all occurances of services to actions.">

{% important %}

If you write automations in YAML, you will notice that the `service` key
in your actions is now called `action`. For example:

```yaml
- action: light.turn_on
  target:
    area: living_room
```

Existing UI-managed automations will be automatically converted the next time they
are edited and saved. If you write automation in YAML, you can
use either `action` or `service`, as this change is fully backward compatible,
but we recommend using `action` from now on.

{% endimportant %}

## Sort data tables by created or last modified

You've added a new integration, a new device, or maybe just updated
Home Assistant and wondering what new entities or devices you have available?

This release will help you with that. Home Assistant now tracks when entities
and devices, and many other things were created or last modified. If these are
shown in a table, it means you can now sort them by the date they were created
or last modified; helping you find those recently added or modified items.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/data-tables-created-modified-columns-sorting.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new created and modified columns of the entities table, allowing one to sort on these new values.">

The created and modified columns are hidden by default, but you can make them
visible by clicking the {% icon "mdi:cog" %} icon at the top right of the
table. Sorting is always available, regardless of the columns' visibility.

You might notice that most entities and devices do not have this created or
modified data populated yet. Well this data has only started being recorded in
this release, and cannot be applied retroactively, but going forward it should
only get more useful.

## Control Home Assistant using AI with Ollama

In the 2024.6 release, we introduced the ability to use the [OpenAI] and
[GoogleAI] {%term integrations %} to [control your home using Large Language Models]
(LLMs). Many of you requested this to work with a local hosted LLM as well.

Today we are happy to announce that Home Assistant now supports
control via local LLMs too!

This is achieved thanks to [@Shulyaka] adding support for the brand new tools
API in Ollama. The performance of the local models has been fine tuned by
[@AllenPorter].

Allen created a new [LLM benchmark suite] that is more balanced, less focused
on edge cases, and uses fewer exposed entities. We scored the different models
with this new benchmark, and the cloud-based models scored 98%, but local LLMs
did not do nearly as well.

Through prompt tuning and fixes included in this release, we have gotten local
LLMs to score a reasonable 83%. We will continue to test new models while
improving our prompts and tools to achieve a higher score.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/llama-3.1-iteration.png" alt="Graph showing the iteration progress of implementing local Ollama support using the Llama 3.1 8B model.">

If you want to experiment with local LLMs using Home Assistant, we currently
recommend using the Llama 3.1 8B model and exposing fewer than 25 entities. Note
that smaller models are more likely to make mistakes.

### Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations

It is not just new {% term integrations %} that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:

- The [HomeKit Bridge] integration now supports the event entities representing
  doorbells and motion sensors. Big thanks [@bdraco]!
- To use the above HomeKit feature, [@bdraco] added support for event entities
  to the [UniFi Protect], [Doorbird], and [August] integrations. Awesome!
- Talking about event entities, [@mib1185] added event entities to the
  [Feedreader] integration. So you can now easily automate when a new article
  shows up in one of the news feeds you follow. Great!
- The [OpenAI conversation] integration now defaults to the, much cheaper,
  gpt-4o-mini model. Thanks [@allenporter]!
- The [WLED] integration now supports CCT LED strips, thanks to [@Suxsem]!
- [Tessie] received lots of attention from [@Bre77] this release, adding
  tons of new entities and features to the integration. Great job!
- [@joostlek] and [@andrew-codechimp] have been extending the [Mealie]
  integration with a lot of new actions and features. Most notably, the ability to
  import recipes, set meal plans, and view shopping lists. Thanks!
- You can now control your Reolink chime with the [Reolink] integration, thanks
  to [@starkillerOG]!
- The [Roborock] integration now supports the [Roborock Zeo] washer/dryer.
  Cool [@Lash-L]!
- [@tr4nt0r] migrated the [Habitica] Dailies and to-do's to support our
  to-do entities. Nice!
- Thanks to [@tanchu], the [Xiaomi Miio] integration now supports Xiaomi
  air purifiers and humidifiers. Great!
- [@bieniu] extended the [Shelly] integration to support [Shelly virtual components].
  These virtual components can be used to add Home Assistant entities to your
  Shelly device, such as the [Shelly WallDisplay] dashboard, or pass
  Home Assistant sensor data to [Shelly scripts]. Nice!

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Bluesound]**, done by [@LouisChrist]
- **[Genius Hub]**, done by [@GeoffAtHome]
- **[History stats]**, done by [@gjohansson-ST]
- **[Mastodon]**, done by [@andrew-codechimp]
- **[Russound RIO]**, done by [@noahhusby]

### Farewell to the following

The following {% term integrations %} are also no longer available as
of this release:

- **UE Smart Radio** has been removed; the service has been [discontinued](https://forums.slimdevices.com/forum/user-forums/general-discussion/1668327-uesmartradio-com-and-mysqueezebox-com-servers).

## Zigbee Home Automation (ZHA) updates

The [Zigbee Home Automation] (ZHA) got a massive overhaul this release!

What this means for you? Well... basically: _**nothing**_! And this sounds odd,
but that is a good thing!

The whole integration has been split into a separate codebase, making it
easier to maintain and improve. This is a huge step forward for the integration,
and took months of work to get done.

You will not notice anything different right now, but this change will make the
integration easier to maintain and improve in the future, including allowing
code contributors to contribute more easily.

Thanks for the dedication and the huge amounts of hard work on this integration
[@dmulcahey], [@puddly], and [@TheJulianJES]! ü•∞

## Matter updates

There are a couple of updates for the Matter integration this release, while we
are working hard to get the integration ready for official Matter certification.

The Matter integration can now provide update entities. If your Matter device
has a firmware update available, Home Assistant will now be able to inform you
about it and update the device for you. üéâ

<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-08/matter-updates.png" alt="Screenshot showing an firmware update for an Matter device being able and can be installed straight from the Home Assistant UI."></p>

This update feature is available for all Matter devices, where manufacturers
provide firmware updates via the official Matter update channels. Not many
manufacturers are involved in delivering these updates yet, but this is a great
step forward, and we hope many manufacturers using Matter will follow this
example.

Event entities provided by the Matter integration have been improved. They
will now provide more event types, allowing you to react to things like single
press or double press events with ease.

Additionally, [@jvmahon] contributed support for select entities to the Matter
integration. This is used to select modes if your Matter device supports them,
such as laundry, oven, or dishwasher modes.

These last two features, are amazing improvements to the Matter integration,
but they are mainly a highlight. Many Matter device types have seen improvements,
including more (configuration) entities and other improvements.

[@jvmahon]: https://github.com/jvmahon

## KNX can now be managed via the UI

The [KNX integration] introduces the ability to manage entities directly from the
UI. üéâ

If you have an ETS project file, configuring your devices is now more
intuitive; you can easily select an actuator from the side panel and drag and
drop its assigned group addresses into the configuration. Alternatively,
addresses can be found by name or number using dropdown menus.

Create, update, and delete KNX switch and light entities directly from the KNX
panel without touching any YAML. üòé

<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-08/knx-panel-for-creating-entities.png" alt="Screenshot showing the KNX panel that allows to create entities right from the UI."></p>

More improvements have been made under the hood. One of the most notable changes
is the support for a broader range of Data Point Type (DPT) definitions. These
can be used directly within actions and triggers and inspected
in the KNX GroupMonitor.

Thank you for working so hard on this one [@farmio]; this is awesome! ü•∞

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- We are proud of our¬†[Open Home Foundation], so we will now show its pretty
  logo on the Home Assistant loading and information screens. Thanks [@balloob]!
- [Timer support] using [Assist] for mobile devices. This means you can now
  control timers from your mobile device or tablet. Thanks [@balloob]!
- You can now ask [Assist] for the current time and date, thanks [@synesthesiam]!
- [@synesthesiam] also switched our voice activity detection to [microVAD]!
  Using this we are able to detect the end of a speech command much better
  in noisy environments, even with music in the background. Cool!
- The [picture elements card] can now be fully managed in the UI using a
  brand-new visual editor. Fantastic work there [@karwosts]!
- Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if a script can't be set up
  (for example, because of YAML syntax errors). Thanks [@emontnemery]!
- If Home Assistant finds an integration set up that has been removed
  (like when you remove a custom integration), it will now raise a repair issue
  to help you clean up anything left behind. Thanks [@joostlek]!
- [Group] now has support for grouping two new entity types. [@joostlek] added
  support for grouping [notify] entities, and [@frenck] added support for grouping
  [button] entities. Nice!
- The [Generic Thermostat] and [Hygrostat] helpers will now be linked to the
  device that provided the actuator entity, thanks [@dougiteixeira]!
- [@gjohansson-ST] did the same, he added a link to the [History stats] helper
  to the device that provided the sensor entity.
- You can now set up [button], [image], [select], and [switch] templates
  entities, straight from the UI. Awesome job [@dougiteixeira]!
- [@karwosts] added a button to the actions developer tools to copy the action
  response as JSON for use in templates. Nice!

## Integrations and helpers set up via YAML, now visible in the UI!

Most popular {% term integrations %} and helpers can be set up directly from the
Home Assistant user interface. However, we still have a lot of older or less
used integrations that can only be set up using [manual YAML configuration](/docs/configuration/yaml/).
We are working hard to move [more and more of these integrations to the UI](#now-available-to-set-up-from-the-ui),
however, this takes time and effort. 

The problem with these integrations is that they are not visible in the UI
when they are set up using YAML. What we often see is that someone sets up
an integration using YAML and then cannot see it on the integrations page,
often resulting in questions in our community about where to find it.

As of this release, we have drastically improved this situation. All integrations,
regardless of how they are set up, are now visible on the integrations page
in the UI. This means that even if you set up an integration using YAML,
you can now find it in the UI and view its provided entities.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-08/yaml-integration-listed.png" alt="Screenshot showing the demo integration, which is set up manually via YAML, showing up in the UI on the integrations dashboard.">

Integrations originating from manual YAML configuration can be recognized by the
{% icon "mdi:file-code-outline" %} icon showing on their cards.

Similarly, we also have [many helpers](/integrations/#helper) that can be set up
using YAML configuration. These sometimes showed up in the UI, but often did not.
We have adjusted this as well, and made sure that all helpers are now visible
in the UI, regardless of how they are set up.

{% note %}
Things set up manually using YAML are still managed using YAML. This means that
if you want to change the configuration of these integrations or helpers, you
will need to do so in the YAML configuration files.

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Recorder database upgrade notice" %}

This notice applies only if you use the recorder integration with a MySQL or
PostgreSQL database. If you are using the default SQLite database,
you can ignore it.

This release includes a database upgrade/migration that increases the size of
the number we can store for the identifier fields. For a more technical
explanation, we are upgrading integer fields for ID columns from a 32-bit
integer to¬†`BIGINT`, which is a 64-bit integer.

This can cause the database upgrade to take longer than usual, depending on
the size of your database.

Please be patient and let the upgrade process finish. Do not interrupt the
upgrade process, as this can lead to a corrupted database.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "BlinkStick" %}

The Blinksticklight integration is disabled because it requires software that
is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcome.

[#121846]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121846

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Bluesound" %}

Sources behave slightly differently. Radio station providers (like TuneIn and
Radio Paradise) are no longer part of the source list and are not selectable
as sources.

Presets that play a specific radio station can be created in the BluOS app and
are displayed as sources in Home Assistant.

The currently selected source tries to match those presets and falls back to
the radio station provider (like TuneIn, Radio Paradise).

{% details "BMW Connected Drive" %}

Describing attributes `car` and `vin` have been removed from BMW entities.
If you need to look them up, please get them from the device info screen.

{% details "Climate" %}

Scenes that use the deprecated auxiliary heat (`aux_heat`¬†attribute)
will no longer restore/set the auxiliary heat state when the scene
is activated.

{% details "DoorBird" %}

Previously, resetting the device favorites required working out a complicated
URL. A button is now available to perform this operation.

is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcomed.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ecovacs" %}

The attributes on the vacuum entity for the lifespan of the main brush,
side brush, and filter are deprecated and will be removed in 2025.2.

These attributes are superseded by dedicated sensor entities.

[#122740]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/122740

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit Bridge" %}

PM2.5 air quality sensors are now mapped to the [US EPA AQI scale](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-02/pm-naaqs-air-quality-index-fact-sheet.pdf).
The new cutoff value for US AQI Good (0-50) is 9.0 ¬µg/m3 is thus now used to
match the 2024 US EPA AQI standard.

[#109900]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109900

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Lights" %}

The following attributes are no longer saved in the database for light
entities because their combinations would quickly fill up the database, and
they are never used by Home Assistant:

- `brightness`
- `color_mode`
- `color_temp`
- `color_temp_kelvin`
- `effect`
- `hs_color`
- `rgb_color`
- `rgbw_color`
- `rgbww_color`
- `xy_color`

This change will not impact the operation of your lights, but it will
reduce the amount of data stored in the database.

[#121776]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121776

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Matter" %}

Multi-press events are now split into their own dedicated event type, such as
`multi_press_1`,¬†`multi_press_2`, etc., making it easier to automate multiple
presses instead of looking manually at the number of presses count.

If you have used the current event type in your automations, you will need to
update them to use the new event types.

[#122191]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/122191

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

The `schema` option has been removed from the MQTT vacuum schema. YAML configs
still containing this option will break after 6 months of deprecation. Users
have been warned with a repair. Discovery configs will not break if the schema
options are still in the config, but they will be ignored, and an error message
will be logged to notice.

{% details "MVG" %}

([@joostlek] - [#121975]) ([documentation](/integrations/mvglive))

The MVG integration is disabled because it requires software that
is not open source. Any help or contributions to make this integration work
without the closed-source software is welcome.

[#121975]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121975

{% enddetails %}

{% details "National Weather Service (NWS)" %}

NWS weather entities no longer have a `detailed_description` in the return
from the `weather.get_forecasts` service.

A new service, `nws.get_forecasts_extra`, is provided that includes
`detailed_description`. The `detailed_description` is no longer provided
for `hourly` forecasts in the `nws.get_forecasts_extra` service as the API
does not return data. However a `short_description` is now available.

[#117254]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/117254

{% enddetails %}

{% details "NextBus" %}

The `messages`, `directions`, and `attribution` attributes have been removed from
the sensor. The new API doesn't provide these anymore.

([@ViViDboarder] - [#121133]) ([documentation](/integrations/nextbus))

[@ViViDboarder]: https://github.com/ViViDboarder
[#121133]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/121133

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenAI Conversation" %}

The previously deprecated `256`, `512`, and `1024` values for the size argument
for the `generate_image` action have been removed. They have already been
unsupported in the past (replaced with `1024x1024` by default).

If you still use these values in your automations or scripts, you will need to
update them to use "1024x1024", "1024x1792", or "1792x1024" values.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "WLED" %}

The WLED integration now requires a WLED device running at least
[WLED 0.14.0](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/releases/tag/v0.14.0)

([@frenck] - [#122101]) ([documentation](/integrations/wled))

[#122101]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/122101

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Xiaomi Miio" %}

The `Nature` and `Normal` preset modes will be renamed to `nature`
and `normal` to support translations.

If you have automations or scripts that use the `Nature` or `Normal` preset
modes, you will need to update them to use `nature` and `normal` instead.
