I hope everyone survived the April 1 jokes a bit? üê∏ We are already at the 15th
edition of the Home Assistant Community Highlights! Some interesting things popped
up around our community, we thought was worth sharing.

Do you want to share something for the next edition?
Information on [how to share](#got-a-tip-for-the-next-edition).

## Blueprint of the week

It may have happened to you (at least to me), you ask something to your Google or
Alexa speaker and it responds with a very low volume. Of course you want to avoid
this, because now you can ask your question again ü§®

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/set-day-or-night-volume-to-speaker/294217" %}

With the blueprint of [andreas1](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/andreas1) you
can automatically adjust the volume of your media player at a set day and night time.
Read more about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or install this automation

## Lovelace Dashboard

Perhaps we should make this a regular item, because this week also a new Lovelace
dashboard. This time made by [JonathanGraft](https://www.reddit.com/user/JonathanGraft/).
Take a look at the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/mi2501/saw_others_sharing_their_dashboards_here_are_some/) on Reddit,
there you will find more photos and shared YAML code.

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/mi2501/saw_others_sharing_their_dashboards_here_are_some/" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-04-02-community-highlights/dashboard.png'
            alt="Lovelace dashboard"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

## Banner Card

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://gh-card.dev/repos/nervetattoo/banner-card.svg?link_target=_blank"></object>

The more you put in your dashboards, the more unclear it can become. You could, for
example thematize some cards, so that it stands out and can be found quickly and the
[banner-card](https://github.com/nervetattoo/banner-card) from [nervetattoo](https://github.com/nervetattoo) could
just be a handy addition to that.

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/nervetattoo/banner-card" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-04-02-community-highlights/banner-card.png'
            alt="How the banner-card will looks like"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:80%;'
        />
    </a>
</div><br>

Small tip: if the CSS style is not quite what you want, you can still use
[card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) from thomasloven to adjust everything üòâ

## Automated Hydroponic

This week we also came across something very impressive, [edward_snowedin](https://www.reddit.com/user/edward_snowedin/)
shared his hydroponic installation on our [subreddit][reddit] page. It‚Äôs a fully automated
system that is controlled via Home Assistant and [ESPHome][esphome].

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydroponics/comments/mgrmwk/esponics_my_attempt_at_automating_hydroponic/" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-04-02-community-highlights/botanist.jpg'
            alt="The hydroponic installation"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;'
        />
    </a>
</div><br>

Curious how everything is worked out in detail? You will find a lot of
information [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydroponics/comments/mgrmwk/esponics_my_attempt_at_automating_hydroponic/gsuomae/)
and also a list of used parts.
