Home Assistant Core 2022.8! 🏖

While many of you enjoy a well-deserved vacation around this time, it seems
like it didn't slow down the development/contributions made to Home Assistant.
What a beautifully packed release this is again!

I’m super stoked about the added Bluetooth support, opening up a whole new
world of devices to Home Assistant. I’m even more excited about the new repairs
and supported brands features. Those are going to help out A LOT 😃.

Do you know what is really great about this release? All the major features and
changes announced in this release are a step forward to our current goal:
Streamlining experiences.

Enjoy the release!

## Introducing Repairs: You can fix it!

A completely new feature we hope you are going to love: **Repairs**! 👷‍♂️

The repairs dashboard can be found in the settings menu and is a place where
Home Assistant can notify you of issues that you can (and should) fix!

From detected current issues on your system to future issues, e.g., caused
by the use of a feature that will be removed, and anything in between.
The problems reported by the repair dashboard are actionable and resolvable
by you.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-08/repairs.png' alt='Screenshot showing the repairs dashboard, with some reported and repairable issues'>

These repairable issues reported can be anything and are specifically tailored
to your Home Assistant instance. Clicking on an issue will show you more
information about it and tell you what you need to do to fix it.

Sometimes, this needs manual intervention by, for example, updating your YAML
configuration; Other times, it will automatically fix an issue for you after it
asks you to confirm it or after asking you to make a choice.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-08/repairs-issue-details.png' alt='Screenshot showing details shown by a repairable issue, providing information on how to resolve it.'>

This release can detect about 25 issues now, and additionally, if a
[Home Assistant Alert] is found that matches your system, it will also show up
in the repairs dashboard.

There are many use cases for the new repairs feature, and you can expect
it to be extended a lot, with more issue detections, in the near future.

[Home Assistant Alert]: /integrations/homeassistant_alerts

## First-class Bluetooth support

Today, we proudly announce that Home Assistant now has **first-class**
Bluetooth support! 🥇 

A brand new [Bluetooth integration] has been added, which provides absolutely
amazing Bluetooth support to Home Assistant, including automatic discovery of
new devices and the ability to push device updates.

Integrations that implement device support can easily be built on top of these
features, meaning we now have a solid base in Home Assistant to unlock
support for many Bluetooth devices out there!

The screenshot below shows that the Bluetooth integration is set up, and it
discover a new device. In this case, it discovered a Mi Flora Flower
care sensor device.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-08/bluetooth.png' alt='Screenshot showing the integration page, with an active Bluetooth integration and a Mi Flora plant sensor device being discovered'>

A good example is the [SwitchBot] integration. It has been updated to support
the new Bluetooth integration, and because of that, is now a push-based
integration providing a much more stable experience.

This release adds five integrations built on this: [SensorPush],
[Govee], [INKBIRD], [Moat], and [Xiaomi BLE]. The latter also provides
support for the reasonably popular Mi Flora plant sensors.

Suppose you are using the Home Assistant OS on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, or are
using a [supported Bluetooth adapter]. In that case, the Bluetooth integration
will work out of the box for new installations and is automatically discovered
on existing setups.

Shout out to [@bdraco] for creating this fantastic new addition, [@Ernst79] for
providing implementation feedback, and his excellent work on the
[ble_monitor] custom integration, which was an inspiration for the
Bluetooth integration. Lastly, a shout out to [@Jc2k] for implementing the
[Xiaomi BLE] integration that greatly helped with testing. Thanks guys! 🙏

## HomeKit Bluetooth support

To continue the story on Bluetooth, the [HomeKit Controller] now also
supports Bluetooth and leverages the above-mentioned new Bluetooth
integration 🎉

In case you didn't know, the [HomeKit Controller] integration allows you
to connect to HomeKit-capable devices and integrate them directly into
Home Assistant. Allowing you to monitor and control these devices,
they support push-based updates and, above all: Are entirely local!

You don't need to own or have an Apple phone or computer to use this!

Supporting HomeKit Bluetooth-capable devices is fantastic! It makes a lot of
devices out there compatible with Home Assistant that have no other way of
integrating. There are lots of door locks, wall plugs, and other smart devices
that you can use now.

Thanks for the work on this [@Jc2k] and [@bdraco]!

## Finding the integration supporting your device

Some integrations work with multiple different brands. This can happen because,
for example, those devices share a communication protocol, are white-labeled
and sold under numerous brand names, or may carry different brand names
depending on where in the world they are sold.

For example, if you have a Luxaflex cover, you can actually use it using the
Hunter Douglas PowerView integration. And this is not the only example;
there are many more! The problem is, how would one know that?

To make setting up things in Home Assistant easier, integrations can now
support multiple brands! So, if you now add an integration in Home Assistant
and search for Luxaflex, you will find one!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-08/supported-brands.png' alt='Screenshot demonstrating the supported brands; it is now to search for a brand that is supported by another integration'>

When you add a new integration that is supported by another integration,
Home Assistant will tell you which integration provides the support and
guides you to set up that integration.

## Better maps colors

Maps have had a slight makeover and now use a new color palette. These new
colors provide much greater contrast and significantly improve their readability.

Especially if you are using the dark mode in the user interface of
Home Assistant, you will notice a big difference.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-08/maps-colors.png' alt='Screenshot demonstrating the new map colors in both light and dark mode'>

Thanks to [@KTibow] for getting the ball rolling on this one, [@matthiasdebaat]
for providing UX feedback, and [@bramkragten] for making this change.

## Breaking Changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Advantage Air" %}

Each AC will have its own device, different from the one previously created.
Any automations or scripts that target the device will need to be corrected.

([@Bre77] - [#75395]) ([documentation](/integrations/advantage_air))

[@Bre77]: https://github.com/Bre77
[#75395]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/75395

---

The previsouly deprecated `advantage_air.set_myzone` has been removed.
Use the available MyZone select entity instead.

([@Bre77] - [#75160]) ([documentation](/integrations/advantage_air))

[@Bre77]: https://github.com/Bre77
[#75160]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/75160

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Calendar" %}

Calendar description attributes are no longer written into the recorder database.

([@allenporter] - [#75375]) ([documentation](/integrations/calendar))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#75375]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/75375

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HERE Travel Time" %}

The single HERE Travel Time sensor with attributes is split up into separate
sensors for Duration, Duration in Traffic, Route, Distance, Origin, Destination.

If you used the entity attributes in your automation or scripts, you will need
to adapt them to this change.

([@eifinger] - [#72405]) ([documentation](/integrations/here_travel_time))

[@eifinger]: https://github.com/eifinger
[#72405]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72405

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit Controller" %}

The ecobee Fan mode number entity has been removed as HomeKit Controller
[now implements fan mode](/integrations/climate/#service-climateset_fan_mode)
on the climate entity which replaces this functionality.

([@bdraco] - [#74440]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit_controller))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#74440]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/74440

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LIFX" %}

Each LIFX device now has its integration entry. The existing entry will be
migrated to separate entries automatically as each device is discovered,
and will automatically be removed once all devices are found.

Migrating to a integration entry per device model allows Home Assistant to
take care of discovery IP updates and retries, dramatically improving the
integration's reliability.

LIFX can now be configured manually by IP address. DHCP, HomeKit,
and native discovery are supported for updating IP addresses to
ensure we never lose track of a device.

Advanced YAML configuration is deprecated and will be removed
in a future release. Advanced YAML configuration is no longer necessary as the
integration now fully utilizes [Network Configuration](/integrations/network/),
and can also function without working discovery.

([@bdraco] - [#74316]) ([documentation](/integrations/lifx))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#74316]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/74316

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Logger" %}

Timestamps in the Home Assistant log file now include millisecond-level
resolution.

Scripts or external log system that rely on this will need to be updated
to handle the extra decimal places.

([@puddly] - [#74518]) ([documentation](/integrations/logger))

[@puddly]: https://github.com/puddly
[#74518]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/74518

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Material Design Icons" %}
