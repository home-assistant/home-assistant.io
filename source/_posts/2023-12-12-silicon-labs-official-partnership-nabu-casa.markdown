[Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/) has entered an official partnership with [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/) to offer support for our open-source and hardware efforts.

Silicon Labs is the company behind Z-Wave and designs chips for Z-Wave, Zigbee, Thread, and more standards. Their chips provide connectivity to many devices, including Philips Hue, Ring, IKEA TRÃ…DFRI, and our own [Home Assistant Yellow](/yellow) and [Home Assistant SkyConnect](/skyconnect) products. In fact, every Z-Wave chip in a Z-Wave product ever made came from Silicon Labs.

We love open standards because they live up to our [Open Home values](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/12/23/the-open-home/) for the smart home: privacy, choice, and sustainability. This is why Nabu Casa, with the revenue received from Home Assistant Cloud subscribers, invests heavily in integrating these open standards, which involves working on a daily basis with Silicon Labs technologies. For example, we employ [Dominic](https://github.com/alcalzone) to work full-time on [Z-Wave JS](https://github.com/zwave-js) and [Nikita](https://github.com/puddly) to work full-time on [Zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy), the library powering Zigbee in Home Assistant. Other developers are dedicated to making sure the Silicon Labs chips inside our own hardware work perfectly in Home Assistant.

Z-Wave JS is the only open-source implementation of Z-Wave, powering an increasing number of Z-Wave platforms beyond Home Assistant. Our work is fundamental to the growth of the Z-Wave ecosystem, and we are happy to see this get acknowledged by Silicon Labs with this partnership. With Home Assistant, we are exposed to many different devices running Z-Wave, Zigbee, and Thread. And as a partner, we are now able to collaborate with Silicon Labs to report bugs and get our issues fixed with priority.
