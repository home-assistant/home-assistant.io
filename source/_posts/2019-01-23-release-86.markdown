Today we're releasing Home Assistant 0.86. And oh wow, this is an amazing release. First awesome thing: the Lovelace user interface, which we've been working on for the last 8 months, is now the default in Home Assistant. We have a lot to talk about, so we created a separate blog post just for the Lovelace release [here](/blog/2019/01/23/lovelace-released/).

Next up, we've updated the [Home Assistant demo](https://demo.home-assistant.io). It's snappier, it's snazzier, and best of all: it contains four fully functional Lovelace user interfaces that you can play with! Change the states or go in config mode and add, edit or re-organize the cards. We've set it up in such a way now that the demo will be automatically updated with the latest release of Home Assistant, so it will always feature the latest things.

## Zigbee management panel

This release includes a brand new Zigbee management panel to manage your Zigbee network thanks to the hard work by [@dmulcahey] with the help of [@Adminiuga] and [@damarco]. The new panel makes it easy to:

 - Issue Permit and Remove operations
 - Reconfigure Node, which will rebind and reconfigure the reporting for a device. Which can help solve issues.
 - Reading and setting cluster attributes. This is useful for viewing and setting things such as device sensitivity levels.
 - View and issue cluster commands. Note on this feature: support for commands with arguments is coming soon.

The Zigbee team is also planning a bunch of cool things for 2019. Direct device binding (directly pairing remotes to lights) is already in development and they are planning support for group management as well. Targeted and broadcast joins are also right around the corner (we’re waiting for a new Zigpy release). Exciting times for Zigbee users!

## Noteworthy backward-incompatible changes

Update: the entity ID one was too harsh, it's now a warning.

This release also includes two noteworthy backward-incompatible changes. One is a follow-up on the slugify breaking change from last release. We did not update the validation check for config options that need to be valid slugs. This means that some of your config values might be invalid. Keep an eye at the console as we have a new message to tell you which ones are wrong.

The following things are not allowed in entity IDs:

 - No capital letters
 - No leading or ending underscores
 - No double underscores

This issue also impacts the entity registry, which could contain in some cases invalid entity IDs. Expect entity IDs to change if they contained a double underscore (which becomes 1) or if they started/ended in an underscore (which will be removed).

Another noteworthy breaking change (sorry!), is that the automation `time` trigger has been split into two: `time` and `time_pattern`. If you had a time trigger containing the keys `hours`, `minutes` or `seconds`, update the platform from `time` to `time_pattern`.

## Backward-incompatible changes

- Automation: Split time_pattern triggers from time trigger ([@armills] - [#19825]) ([automation.interval docs]) ([automation.time docs]) (breaking change)
- Each instance of Home Assistant will now generate it's own unique webhook url for Geofencyto use. One will need to be generated and provided to the iOS app to replace the existing url: `https://myhome.duckdns.org/api/geofency?api_password=HA_PASSWORD` ([@rohankapoorcom] - [#18951]) ([geofency docs]) (breaking change)
- Nest sensor: Correctly map hvac_state to Home Assistant states. Heating -> heat, Cooling -> cool. ([@mitchellrj] - [#19895]) ([sensor.nest docs]) (breaking change)
- Add nad telnet media player and merge nadtcp into media_player.nad ([@rymsha] - [#19704]) ([media_player.nad docs]) (breaking change)
- Prezzi Benzina: Added the service type to the name of the sensor to better differentiate between different service tiers. ([@eliseomartelli] - [#19980]) (breaking change)
- PostNL attributes are updated, contain now more information ([@basbl] - [#18334]) (breaking change)
- Support for multiple Fibaro gateways. A list of gateways is expected instead of a single config. ([@pbalogh77] - [#19705]) ([fibaro docs]) ([binary_sensor.fibaro docs]) ([cover.fibaro docs]) ([light.fibaro docs]) ([scene.fibaro docs]) ([sensor.fibaro docs]) ([switch.fibaro docs]) (breaking change)
- Upgrade greeneye_monitor to 1.0. It now requires the full 8 digit serial number. ([@jkeljo] - [#19631]) ([greeneye_monitor docs]) (breaking change)
- Previous "manual" registration of roku devices will need to be updated or removed (discovery should discover all rokus on your network). ([@soberstadt] - [#17548]) ([roku docs]) ([media_player.roku docs]) ([remote.roku docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)
- Alarm control panel entities will now use `number` as their code_format instead of `Number` ([@balloob] - [#20077]) ([alarm_control_panel docs]) (breaking change)
- OpenUV: users will now need to use the openuv.update_data service to request new data from the API. ([@bachya] - [#19949]) ([openuv docs]) (breaking change)
- Add support for connecting to multiple zoneminder instances ([@rohankapoorcom] - [#19955]) ([zoneminder docs]) ([camera.zoneminder docs]) ([sensor.zoneminder docs]) ([switch.zoneminder docs]) (breaking change)
- The gpslogger device_tracker platform no longer takes any configuration. The configuration needs to be applied to the component gpslogger instead. The platform will be automatically loaded with the component and should not be specified in configuration.yaml. Each instance of Home Assistant will now generate it's own unique webhook for GPSLogger to use. One will need to be generated and provided to the mobile app to the replace the existing url: `https://myhome.duckdns.org/api/gpslogger?api_password=HA_PASSWORD`. Home Assistant only supports using POST (no longer GET) for GPSLogger. The long lived access token is also no longer needed. ([@rohankapoorcom] - [#20044] - [#20079]) ([device_tracker docs]) ([gpslogger docs]) (breaking change)
- The locative device_tracker platform no longer takes any configuration. The configuration needs to be applied to the component locative instead. The platform will be automatically loaded with the component and should not be specified in configuration.yaml. Each instance of Home Assistant will now generate it's own unique webhook url for Locative to use. One will need to be generated and provided to the mobile app to replace the existing url: https://myhome.duckdns.org/api/locative?api_password=HA_PASSWORD. Home Assistant only supports using POST (no longer GET) for Locative. ([@rohankapoorcom] - [#19964] - [#20043]) ([device_tracker docs]) ([locative docs]) (breaking change)
- Sensibo to adhere to the operation mode states in HA climate component. ([@balloob] - [#20180]) ([climate.sensibo docs]) (breaking change) (beta fix)
- Any registered entity that started/ended with an underscore (will be removed) or had 2 subsequent underscores (1 will be removed) will be updated. ([@balloob] - [#20328]) (breaking change) (beta fix)
- The SMA sensor can monitor several new sensors. Unfortunately some of the existing sensors were renamed:
`current_power` is now `grid_power` and `grid_voltage` is now `voltage_l1` (the voltage from all three phases are available). The sensors also support the entity registry, making editing their names a breeze from the frontend. ([@kellerza] - [#19753]) ([sensor.sma docs])
