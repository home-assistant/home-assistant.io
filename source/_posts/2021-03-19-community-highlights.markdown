## Blueprint of the week

It has probably happened to everyone, you forget to put the wheelie bin on the
street and now you have to wait weeks again before it can be emptied again. There
are already various custom integrations where you can keep track of when the pick-up
days are. But maybe the [Blueprint][week_blueprint] from 
[westenberg](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/westenberg), can also help you
to get a notification every time so that you don't forget it.

## It’s a kind of magic

This week we came across another really cool project from [redphx](https://www.reddit.com/user/redphx/)
that was shared on our [subreddit][reddit] page. A lot of inspiration for those who
are still looking for which actions they want to link to their Aqara Magic Cube.

## Retro Record Player

For those who would like to build a media player in a slightly different style in
Lovelave, this is really a cool project. Edwin turned it into something very special
in the form of an LP record player. How cool is this!? ❤️

</div>

On [this website](https://automata.id/record-player/) you will find all information
about this project and how you can build it yourself.

## HomeLab monitor dashboard

Still looking for a way how you would like to set up your own system dashboard? Maybe
the photo of [Akmantainman](https://www.reddit.com/user/Akmantainman/) will give you
some inspiration to make your own version of this.

<blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created="1616150627"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/m6f23i/homelab_monitor_setup/">Homelab Monitor Setup</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant">r/homeassistant</a></blockquote>

Also look in the comments on Reddit, because many people shared their own
version on this post already.
