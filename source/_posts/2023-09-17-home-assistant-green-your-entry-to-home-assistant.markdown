Back in 2021, we launched a crowdfunding campaign for Home Assistant Yellow. Home Assistant Yellow was our take on what a smart home hub should look like, with all the features we enthusiasts want. We're very proud of Home Assistant Yellow, but at the same time, it has become clear that people just starting their smart home journey don't need all the features Yellow offers. With the global component shortages making the required Compute Module 4 more expensive and harder to find, Home Assistant Yellow is no longer a good fit for beginners.

We've taken that to heart, and today, we are introducing an affordable way for new users to upgrade their smart homes to Home Assistant. It's the Home Assistant Green â€“ and it costs only $99 (MSRP).

Home Assistant Green contains everything you need for Home Assistant in one box. Just plug the included power and network cables into the hub, and you'll be up and running. Home Assistant Green will then automatically install the latest version of Home Assistant, the app (mobile or web) will guide you through the setup process, and it will detect your smart devices immediately. This is the easiest way to start using Home Assistant, and it is perfect for you or your friends and family who want to take their first step in home automation.

On the inside, Home Assistant Green runs on a powerful 1.8&nbsp;GHz quad-core CPU. Memory and storage are amply provided with 4&nbsp;GB of RAM and 32&nbsp;GB of eMMC, more than enough to keep you running Home Assistant on the device for a long time. Connecting to your existing smart home platforms lets you instantly use your devices that communicate over Zigbee, Matter, or other smart standards. And when your smart home grows, you can use <a href="/skyconnect">Home Assistant SkyConnect</a> to add Zigbee and Thread radios (Thread support under development) or one of many third-party USB devices available to expand Home Assistant Green with other smart standards like Z-Wave or Bluetooth.

On the outside, Home Assistant Green has a stunning translucent enclosure design revealing the hub's inner hardware. Unlike some other smart home devices, it looks great in your home decor. The bottom of the case also functions as the hub's heat sink and is made of a solid piece of black, anodized aluminum. And, of course, this case features [the new Home Assistant logo][logo-blog] on top as a nice subtle mosaic pattern.
