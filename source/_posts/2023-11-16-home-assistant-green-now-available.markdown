When we launched Home Assistant Green during our [10-year birthday stream](/blog/2023/09/17/10-years-home-assistant/), we had an anniversary batch of 1000 units, which sold out very quickly. If you missed out on that anniversary batch, you've either been waiting for new stock to arrive or you have already pre-ordered from one of our distributors. The good news is that many of our distributors now have stock, and your pre-order should be shipped out soon! For those who have been waiting for new stock, now is your chance to order a Home Assistant Green. We have distributors shipping from the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, and China.

For more information about Home Assistant Green, visit our [product page](/green) or watch the team at Nabu Casa talk about Home Assistant Green's development and features in our anniversary video.
