No stats, no numbers, and alike this time. Ok, just one number: 0.37. We are back on track with our bi-weekly release cycle. Beside some organizational changes is this release shipping again cool features and new integrations. Please keep an eye on the "Backward-incompatible changes" section because there are also massive improvements for some platforms and components.

### Governance
As announced, the new [Governance][gov] requires for developers to sign the CLA. [Code of Conduct][coc], [Contributor License Agreement][cla], and proper [Licensing][license] will to protect all involved parties in the Home Assistant eco-system from users and community members to contributors.

### Face recognition using the Microsoft Face API
[@pvizeli] has been on a roll with the image processing integrations. This time it's the [Microsoft Face API][face]. This means that now it will be possible to train the API with the people you want to recognize and send images from your camera to the API as another source of automation.

Want to play a personalized tune when someone enters the house? It is now possible ðŸ˜Ž

### Improved camera security

After a security audit by Stephen O'Conner, he found that our source for randomly generated access tokens for camera feeds were reasonable predictable and could be brute force attacked in 2.5 weeks. A fix has been included in this release that uses the system provided random number generator for maximum randomness and rotates the keys every 10 minutes to reduce the window in which a brute force attack can happen.

Although the old method is not insecure, the new method is a lot more secure. Upgrading to the latest version is encouraged.

### New customization options
[@Andrey-git] has added some great new options to the customize functionality. It is now possible to specify customizations as a wildcard for entities or for a specific domain.

### Major Wink and HDMI-CEC improvements
[@w1ll1am23] did an amazing job fixing a ton of bugs and issues with the Wink integration. Biggest improvement is that it now is able to automatically refresh the authentication tokens. This means that if you have your email address and password in your `configuration.yaml` file, no `client_id` and `client_secret` are needed, and token which was generated with the generator located in the [Wink][wink] documentation.

The new Wink support will cause renaming of all the binary sensors and will also create new sensors for devices that weren't previously detected or supported in the older version.

Thanks to [@konikvranik] the [HDMI-CEC][cec] integration got a huge update with a lot of improvements. This update should make it easier to work with HDMI-CEC and give you more control.

### First Coffee Maker supported
[@stu-gott] has added support for the first coffee maker in Home Assistant: [Mr. Coffee Smart Optimal Brew][coffee]. Happy brewing!

### Backward-incompatible changes
- A **major** breaking change in the [`emulated_hue`][emul-hue] component means that unless you set `type: alexa` before starting up the newer Home Assistant version you will lose all devices that Alexa has discovered and will need to re-add them as well as create new groups.
- The platform of the [ISS][iss] integration was change to `binary_sensor`. Please check the platform documentation.
- The [Roku][roku] media uses now a new format for the entity IDs.
- [OpenALPR][openalpr] is no longer a component. It's now a platform for [Image processing][image].
- Due to massive improvements of the [Wink][wink] integration, the names of your binary sensors will change and new devices can show up.
- The [MySensors][mysensors] component now requires all persistence file paths to be set if any is set by the user. This is to avoid name conflicts for the paths. If no path is set Home Assistant will set all paths for you.
- The [Sonos][sonos] service `sonos_group_players` was removed. Use now `sonos_join` for this function.
- TTS cache have change for the last time. Files use now also an option hash as part of the name. If you want to use the cache, it need to be renamed or cleared, new created. E. g. `HASH_LANG_PLATFORM.xxx` -> `HASH_LANG_OPTIONS_PLATFORM.xxx`, replace *OPTIONS* with `-` on exiting platforms.
