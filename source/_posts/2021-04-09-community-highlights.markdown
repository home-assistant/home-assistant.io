## Blueprint of the week

You're leaving home and oh dear! It turns out that one of your lights
is on ðŸ’¡ What if you then receive a notification with an option to switch
off the light, without having to open the Home Assistant app first?

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/actionable-notifications-for-android/256773" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-04-09-community-highlights/notify.jpeg'
            alt="Actionable notification demo"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:70%;margin-bottom:10px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

With the blueprint from [vorion](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/vorion)
you can easily get started to create your own actionable notifications, give it
a try. Read more about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or install this
automation in your instance with a click on the my button!

## Google Home

Long ago it was possible to read the alarms and timers from your Google Home
in Home Assistant, due to a change in the API this was unfortunately no longer possible.

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://gh-card.dev/repos/leikoilja/ha-google-home.svg?link_target=_blank"></object>

But thanks to a new [custom integration](https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home)
from [leikoilja](https://github.com/leikoilja), itâ€™s now possible to integrate alarms
or timers that you have set up on a Google Home device. For example, you could switch
the lights automatically in the morning based on an alarm clock that you have set.

## Tempometer Gauge Card

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/SNoof85/lovelace-tempometer-gauge-card" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-04-09-community-highlights/gauge.png'
            alt="Tempometer Gauge card"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:70%;margin-bottom:10px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Are you looking for a card to spice up your existing gauge card?
Then try the [tempometer gauge card](https://github.com/SNoof85/lovelace-tempometer-gauge-card) made by [SNoof85](https://github.com/SNoof85).

## Lovelace Dashboard

This week also a Lovelace dashboard and this time that of [agneevX](https://github.com/agneevX),
the nice thing about this dashboard is that it's designed from a mobile first principle. Which
means that you make a design / dashboard for the smallest screen (mobile) and then work out step
by step how it will look on a larger screen (desktop).

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-04-09-community-highlights/dashboard.png'
            alt="Lovelace dashboard"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:10px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

You can find all his code in [this repository](https://github.com/agneevX/my-ha-setup) on Github.
