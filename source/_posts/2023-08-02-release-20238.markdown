Home Assistant Core 2023.8! üéâ

Another month, another fine release of Home Assistant! This release is a bit more
conservative after two absolutely packed releases in [June](/blog/2023/06/30/release-20236/)
and [July](/blog/2023/06/07/release-20236/). Many of us are enjoying summer holidays üèñÔ∏è.

Pretty much all features in this release are absolutely amazing, and it is hard
to pick a favorite. Great translation improvements that help with the user
experience, a new entity to capture events from things like remotes, and the
new Assist features are, again, mind-blowing!

Talking about Assist, have you seen the blog on [Year of the Voice - Chapter 3](/blog/2023/07/20/year-of-the-voice-chapter-3/)?
Or, check [the live stream recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXzItFksYFA),
where the new features have been demonstrated.

Some new integrations have been added too. Most notably [Opower](/integrations/opower)!
This integration can pull in energy usage data from many utility companies in
the United States. For example, it supports [PG&E](/integrations/pge),
[ComEd](/integrations/comed), [BGE](/integrations/bge), and many more! ‚ö°Ô∏è
Very good news for all our American friends!

Enjoy the release!

## Translated services

All services in Home Assistant are now translatable! üåé

Services are the actions you can call, like turning on a light. This was one of
the bigger parts of Home Assistant that still was only available in English.
Odd, as the Home Assistant interface can be used in 60+ languages!

In this release, translations for these services have been added to drastically
improve the experience when English is not your primary language. For example,
when you use the Dutch language (as used in the screenshot below), the service
to turn on a light is now also translated into Dutch.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/translated-services.png' alt='Screenshot showing the Home Assistant interface in the Dutch language, showcasing the translations for service calls.'>

A big step forward! Implementing this change has resulted in a substantial
increase in the number of translations. They have doubled! üòÖ

Because of that, translating all services might take some time; however‚Ä¶
You can help! You don‚Äôt have to be a developer to help with this; you can do this
from the comfort of your browser. Check out our documentation on
[how to contribute translations](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/translations).

## Introducing the event entity

Events are signals that are emitted when something happens, for example, when
someone presses a physical button like a doorbell or when a button on a remote
control is pressed.

If you have ever tried to work with events in Home Assistant, you probably
noticed that it was not the easiest thing to do. You need to know the event name,
and then you need to know the data that is being sent with it. Before you know it,
you'll start fiddling with the developer tools to figure out what is going on.

To make this all easier, we are introducing a new entity type in this release:
[The event entity](/integrations/event).

The event entity can capture these events in the physical world and makes them
available in Home Assistant as an entity. Take for example, this Hue remote:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/events-hue-dimmer-switch.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new event entities provided by a Philips Hue remote.'>

The beauty of the event entity is that they can be used like any other entity
in Home Assistant: They will show up in the UI, can be used directly in the
automations editor, and provide historical information in the logbook.

Besides [Matter](/integrations/matter), the event entity is also supported by
[HomeKit Devices](/integrations/homekit_controller), [MQTT](/integrations/mqtt),
and [Philips Hue](/integrations/hue). We expect to see more integrations
supporting this new entity type soon.

## Improving the first experience with Home Assistant

Onboarding is a user's first experience with Home Assistant. The onboarding
screens are the first you see, and steps you take when you access Home Assistant
for the first time, setting up things like your account and language preferences.
The goal is to ensure this process is seamless, which is why we've made
improvements to the onboarding experience.

To achieve this, we have implemented a search field on the map during
onboarding. Instead of endlessly dragging the pin on the map around,
you can now easily search for your location.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/onboarding-openstreetmap.png' alt='Screenshot showing you can now enter your address to quickly find your location on the map.'>

This is powered by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Add items to your shopping list using Assist

What if you could ask [Assist] to add items to your
Home Assistant [shopping list](/integrations/shopping_list)? Well, now you can!

> Add milk to my shopping list!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/assist-shopping-list.png' alt='Screenshot showing asking assist to add milk to the shopping list.'>

In case you are wondering, the shopping list integration adds a handy page to
your Home Assistant interface to which everyone in your household can add items.
It is a great way to keep track of what you need to buy, and now you can
add items to it with your voice using Assist!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/shopping-list.png' alt='Screenshot showing the shopping list integration in Home Assistant.'>

To be able to use this feature, you need to have the shopping list integration
set up, which is as easy as clicking the My Home Assistant button below:

{% my config_flow_start badge domain="shopping_list" %}

## Generate an image with OpenAI's DALL-E

In the last release, we added [the ability for services to respond with data](/blog/2023/07/05/release-20237/#services-can-now-respond),
and now we added a service that allows you to generate an image using
[OpenAI's DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2).

All you need is to set up the [OpenAI conversation agent](/integrations/openai_conversation)
integration on your instance, and you will get a new service:
{% my developer_call_service service="openai_conversation.generate_image" %}.

Call this service describing the image you'd like the AI to generate, and
it will respond with an image URL you can use in your automations.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/openai-generate-image.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new generate image service with DALL-E from OpenAI, asking to generate an image of an astronaut riding a unicorn.'>

You could, for example, use this to generate an image of a city that matches
the weather conditions outside of your home, let the AI generate an image
about the latest news headline to show on your dashboard, or maybe generate
a fun image of someone putting out garbage on garbage day.

{% my developer_call_service badge service="openai_conversation.generate_image" %}

You could even combine it with the wildcard support for sentence triggers so you
could ask Home Assistant to generate an image using your voice...

## Wildcard support for sentence triggers

[Sentence triggers](/docs/automation/trigger/#sentence-wildcards) now support
wildcards! This means you can now partially match a sentence, and use the
matched part in your actions. This is what powers the above
[shopping list feature](#add-items-to-your-shopping-list-using-assist)
too, and it can be used for many other things as well.

You could, for example, create a sentence trigger that matches when you say:

> Play the white album by the Beatles

Using the wildcard support, you can get the album and artist name from the spoken
sentence and use those in your actions. To trigger on the above example sentence,
you would use the following command in your sentence trigger:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/sentence-trigger-wildcard-music.png' alt='Screenshot showing an automation that uses a sentence trigger that has wildcards in it.'>

This will make the `album` and `artist` available as trigger variables that you
can use in your actions; for example, to start playing the music requested.

These wildcards are interesting and open up a lot of possibilities!
[Read more about sentence triggers in our documentation](/docs/automation/trigger/#sentence-trigger).

[JLo] realized he could use these wildcards, combined with the new
[generate image service](#generate-an-image-with-openais-dall-e), to let
Home Assistant generate an image and show it on his Chrome Cast-enabled device
just by using his voice! üòé You could ask it:

> Show me a picture of an astronaut riding a unicorn!

He put this together in an automation blueprint, which you can use to do the
same thing in your own Home Assistant instance:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-08/assist-wildcard-dall-e-blueprint.png' alt='Screenshot showing how the blueprint by JLo looks like in Home Assistant.'>

Provide the sentence you like to trigger on and the media player you want to
show the image at, and you're good to go! You can import his blueprint using
the My Home Assistant button below:

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://www.home-assistant.io/blueprints/blog/2023-08/cast_dall_e.yaml" %}

[JLo]: https://github.com/jlpouffier

## Condition selector

A new selector is available for use in, for example, blueprints:
[The condition selector](/docs/blueprint/selectors/#condition-selector).

This selector takes and shows the condition part of the automation editor,
and allows blueprint creators to use a user-provided condition in their
blueprinted automations and scripts.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-08/condition-selector.png'></a>
This blueprint allows one to set a custom condition using the new condition selector.
</p>

## Other noteworthy changes

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Python 3.10 support has been removed" %}

Python 3.10 support has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.
Home Assistant now requires Python 3.11 to run.

You don't have to do anything if you are using Home Assistant OS,
Home Assistant Container, or Home Assistant Supervised installation method.
In those cases, we handle this all for you.

Your system has been using Python 3.11 for quite some time already.

([@frenck] - [#97007])

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#97007]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97007

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Discovery" %}

The legacy discovery integration has been removed. This only affects the
automatic discovery of Enigma2, Yamaha Network Receivers, and Bluesound.

These can still be manually configured as per usual.

Note this is for our very, very old discovery logic. This does not affect the
discovery of any other integration/device/service.

If you still have `discovery:` listed in your YAML configuration, you can
safely remove it.

([@frenck] - [#96856])

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#96856]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96856

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ecovacs" %}

The Ecovacs integration has been migrated to the new "StateVacuumEntity"
under the hood.

The states of the vacuum entity now report not only on or off,
instead `cleaning`, `paused`, `docked` (_implicit mean charging_),
`returning` (_to base_), `idle` and `error`. Further, the actions `turn_on`
(_start cleaning_), and `turn_off` (_stop cleaning and return to base_) were
superseded by three single actions `start`, `stop` and `return_to_base`.

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#95920]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/95920

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Nest" %}

The legacy Works With Nest API is no longer supported. You must manually take
action to use the SDM API by removing the Nest configuration from `configuration.yaml`
and restarting Home Assistant. Then add the Nest integration following the
instructions. Please review the documentation for information about which
devices are supported.

Additionally, as a reminder, the legacy Works With Nest API is [shutting down](https://developers.nest.com/)
in September 2023.

([@allenporter] - [#96111]) ([documentation](/integrations/nest))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#96111]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96111

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

It's no longer allowed for an MQTT RGB light without a `brighness_state_topic`
to report an RGB value of `RGB=0,0,0`. The reason is that for such lights,
the light's brightness is derived from the RGB value, and an RGB value
of `RGB=0,0,0` corresponds to a brightness of 0 which is not allowed.

In case an MQTT RGB light without a `brighness_state_topic` reports `0,0,0`
for R, G, and B, that update will be ignored.

([@jbouwh] - [#96286]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#96286]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96286

---

The MQTT climate `CONF_POWER_STATE_TOPIC` and `CONF_POWER_STATE_TEMPLATE` were
deprecated in HA Core 2023.2.0 and are now removed. Please remove these options
from your configuration. The options were not implemented but will break your
MQTT configuration if they are still present in your config.

([@jbouwh] - [#96771]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#96771]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96771

---

The way MQTT entities are named and how device configuration can be shared
between discovered entities has changed.

**Sharing of device configuration**

Discovered MQTT entities can share device configuration, meaning one entity
can include the full device configuration, and other entities can link to that
device by only setting mandatory fields.

The mandatory fields were previously limited to at least one of
`connection` and `identifiers`, but have now been extended to at least
one of `connection` and `identifiers` as well as the `name`.

**Naming of MQTT entities**

The naming of MQTT entities has been changed to be aligned with the
[entity naming guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#entity-naming):

- The `has_entity_name` entity will be set to `True` on all MQTT entities.
- This means any MQTT entity which is part of a device will [automatically have its `friendly_name` attribute prefixed with the device name](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/#has_entity_name-true-mandatory-for-new-integrations).
- Unnamed `binary_sensor`, `button`, `event`, `number`, and `sensor` entities will
  now be named by their device class instead of being named "MQTT binary sensor" etc.
- It's now allowed to set an MQTT entity's name to `None` to mark it as the
  main feature of a device.

[#95159]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/95159

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Philips Dynalite" %}

The Dynalite configuration panel, which previously was on the Home Assistant
sidebar, has moved. It can now be accessed via the integration page in
**Settings** -> **Device & services** -> **Dynalite** -> **Configure**.

([@frenck] - [#95920]) ([documentation](/integrations/dynalite))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#96853]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/96853

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Renson" %}

The state values of the Reason Ventilation integration have been changed to
be more consistent with other integrations and are now lowercase. Additionally,
it can now provide translations for the state values in the UI.

This means that the following state values have changed:

- `Off` -> `off`
- `Level1` -> `level1`
- `Level2` -> `level2`
- `Level3` -> `level3`
- `Level4` -> `level4`
- `Breeze` -> `breeze`
- `Holiday` -> `holiday`

Please update any automations where you are using the state of this Renson sensor.

  [Xiaomi BLE] integration a long time ago and was in a non-functional state.  
  ([@frenck] - [#96868])
- **Xiaomi Mijia BLE T&H Sensor** has been removed. This integration was
  replaced by the [Xiaomi BLE] integration  a long time ago and was in a
  non-functional state.
