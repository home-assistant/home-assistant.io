Home Assistant Core 2023.5! üéâ

What an exciting release we have for you this month! This release is all about
voice (well, almost fully), and I'm super excited we can ship you all this truly
amazing stuff!

I've been following the progress of this all being built this month, and really,
I've been mindblown multiple times a week. So what is in here? Well, you can
now actually talk to Home Assistant! ü§Ø

I really appreciate that all these voice elements have been built the
Home Assistant way: to be fully configurable and extendable. Giving you choices,
including entirely local options for your own voice assistant.

This release is packed! And we are not even halfway through Home Assistant's
Year of the voice yet‚Ä¶

Enjoy the release!

## Let's talk!

Our goal for 2023 is to let you control Home Assistant in your own language:
It is [Home Assistant‚Äôs Year of the Voice][yotv]! After [chapter 1][chapter1] in
January, [we announced chapter 2][chapter2] in this exciting journey last week!

This release ships everything (plus more) that was announced! This means, as
of this release, you can actually start talking to Home Assistant! üéôÔ∏è

<lite-youtube videoid="0YJzLIMrnGk" videotitle="World‚Äôs Most Private Voice Assistant"></lite-youtube>

## Manage what is exposed to your voice assistants

A brand new and exciting menu item can be found in your {% my config title="**Settings**" %}
menu: {% my voice_assistants title="**Voice&nbsp;assistants**" %}!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-05/voice-assistants.png' alt='Screenshot showing the brand new menu item in the settings menu: Voice assistants.'>

This new settings item gives you access to many fantastic new voice features;
it also provides a new **Expose** tab where you can manage which entities are
exposed to your Assist, Alexa, and Google Assistant.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-05/voice-assistants-expose-entities.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new expose entities tab in the voice assistants menu.'>

It gives an overview of what entities you have exposed to your voice assistants
and easily remove or add new ones. Clicking on an entity in this screen will
bring up the voice assistant setting for that entity, allowing you to turn
on/off the entity's exposure to a specific voice assistant and
manage the entity's aliases.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-05/voice-assistants-expose-entities-settings.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new expose entities tab in the voice assistants menu.'>

This currently supports our [Assist](/voice_control/), and Amazon Alexa and
Google Assistant via Home Assistant Cloud.

## Improved entity setting

Some nice tweaks have been made to the entity settings dialog, making it
easier to use and look cleaner.

The entity settings dialog used to have an expandable advanced section,
which you could expand to access features like showing/hiding/disabling
entities, changing the area, etc.

The advanced section has been removed, and all its features have been
reorganized. So, no features were lost while providing a much nicer
interface.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-05/entity-settings.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new and improved entity settings dialog.'>

And, since this is the year of the voice, you may notice the
**"Voice assistants"** option in the above screenshot, which will bring up:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-05/entity-settings-voice-assistants.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new voice assistant expose controls accessible directly from the entity settings dialog.'>

This allows you to quickly change the voice assistants the entity is exposed
to, including its aliases, without having to navigate back to the voice
assistants panel in the main settings screen.

## Configuring the LEDs of your Home Assistant Yellow

The enclosure of our amazing [Home Assistant Yellow](/yellow) allows you to
look at the beautiful board and parts inside of it.

However, the LEDs on the board might light up your environment when
it is dark in an unwanted way. For example, when you sleep in the same room
as your Home Assistant Yellow is in.

As of this release, you can configure (turn on/off) the disk, heartbeat,
and power LEDs of your Home Assistant Yellow by using the **Configure** button
on the {% my hardware title="**Settings** > **Hardware**" %} page.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-05/home-assistant-yellow-led-controls.png' alt='Screenshot that show the new LED settings for the Home Assistant Yellow.'>

## Webhooks trigger options

Webhooks have been extended this release. We now have support for webhooks
that use the `GET` HTTP method!

But that is not all. Thanks to [@esev], we also got some new security features
for our webhook triggers. You can now set which HTTP methods your
webhook trigger work with and the ability to limit webhooks to only work on
your local network.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-05/webhook-trigger-settings.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new options available on a Webhook automation trigger.'>

## New Assist pipeline and language selectors

If you are building automation or scripts Blueprints, you can now leverage
two new UI selectors for use with your Blueprints: an Assist pipeline selector
and a language selector.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-05/blueprints-language-selector.png' alt='Screenshot showing the language selector.'></a>
The language selector let's a user choose from a list of languages.
</p>

You could, for example, leverage this in a notification Blueprint to allow
setting a different language on a text-to-speech notification.

[More information can be found in our selectors documentation](/docs/blueprint/selectors).

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Accuweather" %}

The `ozone` sensors and the `ozone` state attribute of the weather entity showed
incorrect values and are being removed. If you use these values in your
automations or scripts, you need to update them.

([@bieniu] - [#91492]) ([documentation](/integrations/accuweather))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#91492]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91492

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Android TV" %}

The "Android TV" integration has been renamed to "Android Debug Bridge".

This rename is because that is what it actually controlled/provided. With
the addition of the Android TV Remote integration in this release, we wanted
to reduce possible confusion in the future.

([@tronikos] - [#90657]) ([documentation](/integrations/androidtv))

[@tronikos]: https://github.com/tronikos
[#90657]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90657

{% enddetails %}

{% details "History" %}

All YAML configuration options for the history integration have been removed
as they were no longer used by the frontend.

([@bdraco] - [#90992]) ([documentation](/integrations/history))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#90992]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90992

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

The min/max target humidities for (de)humidifier device exposed over HomeKit
has changed. The HomeKit UI will now show the real relative humidity. When
the slider in HomeKit goes above or below the max/min set humidity, it will
be set back to the max/min allowed humidity.

([@stackia] - [#90854]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@stackia]: https://github.com/stackia
[#90854]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90854

---

Default HomeKit to listen on all interfaces to match Home Assistant behavior.
To limit HomeKit to specific network interfaces, specify an `address`
in `configuration.yaml`.

([@bdraco] - [#91520]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#91520]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91520

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IMAP" %}

The use of `imap_content` event could break for users that want to parse data
from larger email messages from the truncated part. Only the first 2048
bytes of the message body (2 KiB) will be available.

([@jbouwh] - [#92066]) ([documentation](/integrations/imap))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#92066]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92066

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Overkiz" %}

The silence option for DynamicShutter has been removed because it caused the
cover entity to be non-functional if it did not support silence. This
functionality will be reintroduced in a future release.

([@iMicknl] - [#91354]) ([documentation](/integrations/overkiz))

[@iMicknl]: https://github.com/iMicknl
[#91354]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91354

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Reolink" %}

For Reolink doorbells, the "Status LED" light entity is replaced by a
"Status LED" select entity. The switch `off` state corresponds to the select
`Auto`, and the switch `on` state corresponds to the select
`Auto & always on at night`. An additional `Stay off` state is now available.

([@starkillerOG] - [#90469]) ([documentation](/integrations/reolink))

[@starkillerOG]: https://github.com/starkillerOG
[#90469]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90469

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Snapcast" %}

- Muted groups with stream playing will have state `idle` instead of `playing`.
- Connected clients will not have state `on` anymore but use the same states as
  groups: `idle` and `playing`.
- Disconnected clients have state `standby` instead of `off` because the
  Snapcast server still accepts commands.

([@luar123] - [#77449]) ([documentation](/integrations/snapcast))

[@luar123]: https://github.com/luar123
[#77449]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77449

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Synology DSM" %}

The unit conversion for all memory, storage, and network utilization-related
sensors was corrected from binary (_1024_) to decimal (_1000_) base to be in
line with the used measurement units (_eq. MB = 1.000.000 bytes_).

You may need to update the historically recorded units for these sensors via
the statistics page under developer tools.

([@mib1185] - [#90633]) ([documentation](/integrations/synology_dsm))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#90633]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90633

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Templates" %}

The `ensure_ascii` argument for `to_json` in Jinja templates now defaults to
`False`, allowing us to use a faster JSON encoder by default.

This should not be an issue for most, as JSON parsers broadly accept Unicode
input. If you still need to encode Unicode characters inside JSON strings,
set `ensure_ascii` to `True` explicitly to restore the old behavior.

([@depoll] - [#91253])

[@depoll]: https://github.com/depoll
[#91253]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90863

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Network" %}

UniFi integration no longer provides both `hostname` and `host_name` attributes
for a client tracker entity. Only `host_name` will be provided as an attribute.

([@Kane610] - [#91188]) ([documentation](/integrations/unifi))

[@Kane610]: https://github.com/Kane610
[#91188]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91188

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The previous deprecated `set_doorbell_message` service has been removed. Use
the text entity for the UniFi Protect LCD screen instead.

([@AngellusMortis] - [#91523]) ([documentation](/integrations/unifiprotect))

[@AngellusMortis]: https://github.com/AngellusMortis
[#91523]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91523

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Universal Devices ISY/IoX" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Universal Devices ISY/IoX
integration has been removed.

Universal Devices ISY/IoX is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@shbatm] - [#91575]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#91575]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91575

---

The built-in percentage unit `%` is now used for relative humidity and absolute
humidity instead of the custom units `%RH` and `%AH`, respectively.

([@shbatm] - [#90863]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#90863]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90863

---

The following custom ISY994 services have been removed:

- `reload`
- `cleanup_entities`
- `system_query`
- `set_ramp_rate`
- `set_on_level`
- `run_network_resource`
- `set_variable`

These services had been previously deprecated in favor of built-in services
and `number`, `select`, and `button` entities. Please update your automations
and dashboards to use the new entities and/or built-in services if you have
not already.

([@shbatm] - [#91569]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#91569]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91569

---

Dusk/Dawn nodes on Insteon Motion Sensors now have their states inverted to
correctly show "Light detected" during daylight and "No light" when the dusk
sensor is active.

This is reversed from previous behavior. If you rely on this sensor in your
automations, they must be updated.

([@shbatm] - [#92035]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#92035]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92035

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Webhooks" %}

Two new Webhook trigger options have been added that limit how a webhook can
trigger an automation. A new _allowed_methods_ option can be used to control
which HTTP request methods can activate the trigger (`GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, and
`PUT`). And the `local_only` option is used to allow devices outside your local
network to activate the trigger.

Previously all webhook triggers could be activated by `HEAD`, `POST`, and `PUT`
methods from any device (local or on the internet). With the new options, only
`POST` and `PUT` are enabled by default.

In Home Assistant Core 2023.7, any webhook trigger that does not set `local_only`
to false can only be activated by devices on the same network as Home Assistant.

Click the gear/cog icon beside the Webhook ID to update your webhook triggers.
Then select an appropriate value for **Only accessible from the local network**.
It is necessary to deselect the option for the **Save** button to appear. Then
reselect the option if it should be enabled. This will make the repair warning
go away.

![Screenshot shoting webhook trigger options](/images/blog/2023-05/breaking-change-webhook-triggers.png)

See the [webhook trigger documentation](/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger)
for a description of the new options. And please review the new
[Webhook Security](/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-security) section for best
practices when using webhook triggers.

[@esev]: https://github.com/esev
[#66494]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66494

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

With this release, you will need to update your `zwave-js-server` instance.
You must use `zwave-js-server` 1.28.0 or greater (schema 28).

- If you use the `Z-Wave JS` add-on, you need at least version `0.1.79`.
- If you use the `Z-Wave JS UI` add-on, you need at least version `1.11.2`.
- If you use the `Z-Wave JS UI` Docker container, you need at least version `8.14.2`.
- If you run your own Docker container or some other installation method,
  you will need to update your `zwave-js-server` instance to at least `1.28.0`.
