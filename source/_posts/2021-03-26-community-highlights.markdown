## Blueprint of the week

This week's blueprint is all about climate and energy saving,
[SmartLiving.Rocks](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/smartliving.rocks/) has
written a handy blueprint that can switch your climate device based on whether a
window is open or not.

automation in your instance with a click on the my button!

## ESPHome Acquisition

Last week we announced that [ESPHome][esphome] will continue under the umbrella
of [Nabu Casa][nabu_casa] from now on. If you want to hear more about it, be sure
to listen to the latest Home Assistant Podcast in which Paulus explains more about
the future of ESPHome.

## Uptime Card

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://gh-card.dev/repos/dylandoamaral/uptime-card.svg?link_target=_blank"></object>

For those who would like to show their uptime robot status or other types of
binary sensors in a very special way, there is now a new card made by
[dylandoamaral](https://github.com/dylandoamaral) which is inspired on the
uptime status page of [Reddit](https://www.redditstatus.com).

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/dylandoamaral/uptime-card" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-03-26-community-highlights/uptime-card.png'
            alt="How the uptime-card will looks like"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:75%;'
        />
    </a>
</div><br>

Keep in mind that the card is still at an early stage of development.

## DIY Smart Lock

Always wanted to make your door lock smarter? Then try the DIY solution
from [bkbilly](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/bkbilly), with which
you can make your own smart door lock with a stepper motor, 3D printed gears
and ESP32, which communicates with your Home Assistant instance via [ESPHome][esphome].
