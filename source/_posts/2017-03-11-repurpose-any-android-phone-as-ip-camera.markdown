<a href='/integrations/#added_in_current_version'><img src='/images/blog/2017-03-0.40/social.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

It's time for version 0.40 already! For this version, the main focus was on performance and bug fixes. Big thanks to [@pvizeli] for driving this effort. Startup is now super fast. We have also continued with adding warnings for components and platforms that are slowing down Home Assistant.

Some people have interpreted our recent added warnings as if 0.39 introduced the issues that caused the warning. This is not the case, the platforms and components have been misbehaving for a while but now we are adding warnings so we are able to track down the culprits.

Before we continue talking about all the improvements in this release I want to take a moment to thank a few people from the Home Assistant community that are fundamental to the success of Home Assistant. Big thanks to [@dale3h], [@CCOSTAN], [@skalavala], [@rrubin0], [@brahmafear], [@bassclarinetl2], and [@torn8o]! These are all people that hang out in our [main chat channel] and help new users get started and help existing users when running into trouble. Home Assistant would not be there without all the effort you put in! ðŸ™‡

And that our community kicks ass is also shown in the numbers. We have already raised together over $700 for the [EFF] via the sale of [our t-shirts][hass-shirt]! All of you rock! Another number worth mentioning is that this release brings us passed 600 integrations for Home Assistant. All of you rock, again!

## Z-Wave is now threadsafe

[@andrey-git] has spend a lot of time to make Z-Wave perform better. It should no longer cause Home Assistant to run slower or raise warnings about the timer getting out of sync.

## Update on the MQTT Out of Memory errors in 0.39

MQTT started causing "Out of Memory" errors for some people on a Raspberry Pi. We have been able to track this down to Raspberry Pis that are using an older firmware. If you are experiencing this issue, please [upgrade your firmware using `rpi-update`](https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update#installing).

## Turn any Android phone into an IP Camera

With the new support for [IP Webcam](/integrations/android_ip_webcam/) added by [@robbiet480] and [@pvizeli] you are now able to re-purpose any Android phone to become a multifunctional IP webcam. Some of the cool things that you can do:

 - Integrate the Android device camera
 - Binary sensor when motion is detected
 - Sensors to expose the device sensors, including pressure, sound, battery, light
 - Control device features like the GPS, night vision and camera flash

## Other Highlights

 - Support added for Austrian weather using Zamg weather data ([@Zac-HD])
 - Ring.com video doorbell integration added ([@tchellomello])
 - Blink Home Security Camera support added ([@fronzbot])
 - AppleTV has been converted to push data to Home Assistant instead of us having to poll ([@postlund])

## Backward-incompatible changes

- Vera entity ids have changed. This is a one time change to migrate to a model that will prevent future conflicts.
- The Twilio notify platforms now have to be configured via the twilio component.

```yaml
twilio:
  account_sid: "abc"
  auth_token: "xyz"
```

- If you are using async custom components, the passed in `async_add_devices` method is now a callback instead of a coroutine function.

### If you need help...
...don't hesitate to use our very active [forums][forum] or join us for a little [chat][discord]. The release notes have comments enabled but it's preferred if you use the former communication channels. Thanks.
