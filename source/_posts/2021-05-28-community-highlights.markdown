## Blueprint of the week
------

This week's blueprint is all about medication. It may happen that you forget
to swallow it, what if you create an automation that sends you a message as a
reminder every time? [Mati24](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/mati24) has
now made a handy blueprint for that, try it out!

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/advanced-medication-reminder/300137" %}

Read more about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or install this
automation in your instance with a click on the My button!

## Swiper card
------

Not enough space on your Lovelace dashboard? Then try the [swiper card](https://github.com/bramkragten/swipe-card)
made by [bramkragten](https://github.com/bramkragten), with which you can easily
swipe through different cards in the same card frame.

## Lovelace dashboard
------

Also this week we have a new Lovelace dashboard for the necessary portion of inspiration ðŸ˜„
This time the dashboard of [DoIGotSkillz](https://www.reddit.com/user/DoIGotSkillz/),
who made one for use on a tablet wall mount.

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/niyo5h/my_wall_mounted_dashboard/" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-05-28-community-highlights/dashboard.png'
            alt="preview of the Lovelace dashboard"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:80%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Would you also like your dashboard to be in the community highlight? Drop it on
[Reddit][reddit] and maybe I'll pick it out for the next edition.

## Homegame
------

Recently we had an [item][item] about switching entities in Minecraft, well this
time it's a game again but in 2D. [svendroid](https://github.com/svendroid) made
a proof of concept game that you can play in the browser, you can adjust the map
so that your own light entities work with it.

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <img src="https://github.com/svendroid/homegame/blob/master/docs/demo_video.webp?raw=true" 
        alt="Demo of the 2D game"
        style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:80%;margin-bottom:15px;' />
</div>

Doesn't this also remind you of the old Pokemon games from the past? ðŸ˜…
