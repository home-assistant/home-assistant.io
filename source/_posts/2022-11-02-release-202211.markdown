Home Assistant Core 2022.11! üéâ

This November already feels a lot like Christmas üéÑ, what a heck of a
release! Quite a few suggestions from the [Month of "What the Heck?!"](/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck)
already landed! Ready to unpack the presents? üéÅ

Talking about the WTH month, it ended. Well, sort of, at least. It is now closed
for new topics/suggestions, but [existing ones](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/what-the-heck/56)
remain open for discussion and can be voted on. I'm curious to see more of
these WTHs being resolved in the upcoming releases.

This release has so much goodness that I have a hard time picking a favorite.
Water usage, maybe? I'm really not sure, so I'm going to cut this intro short.
Let me know your favorite in the comments below!

Enjoy the release!

## Tile card

This release introduces a new Dashboard card: the "Tile"!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-11/tile-card.png' alt='Screenshot showing a couple of tile cards'>

The tile card is a lovely little card that provides a quick overview of an
entity. The icon can be tapped to toggle the entity, and the rest of the card
brings up the "more info" dialog.

[Read more about the Tile card in the documentation](/dashboards/tile).

This first iteration of the Tile card is one of the first cards added this
release, that brings in a new style of card into Home Assistant.

Curious to find out what else will be coming? Join us for the State
of the Open Home live stream. [Go to YouTube and click the bell üîî](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D936T1Ze8-4)
so you get notified when we go live!

## Statistic card

More cards! We already have the [Statistics Graph card](/dashboards/statistics-graph),
which can be used to display graphs of long-term statistics of an entity.
This release brings the "Statistic" card!

The ‚ÄúStatistic‚Äù card, as the name implies, can show a single value of an entity,
based on the long-term statistics stored of that entity.

For example, want to display the average temperature of your living room this
week on your dashboard? The average power usage of your home today? The peak
power production of your solar panels today?

Yes, all of the above, this card can do!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-11/statistic-card.png' alt='Screenshot showing the UI editor of the statistic card and all of its options'>

[Read more about the Statistic card in the documentation](/dashboards/statistic).

## Smarter reloading of automation & scripts

> [WTH do all automations get reloaded when you change any of them?](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-do-all-automatons-get-reloaded-when-you-change-any-of-them/467270)

Good question! And that WTH topic got over 180+ votes as well!

When you change a single automation or script via the editors in the user
interface (or reload your YAML-based ones), they all get reloaded. This
means if they are running, waiting for something (a delay, an event, or for an
entity to be in a certain state for X time), they would all be reset.

This release changes this behavior, resolving that WTH! Only automations that
are actually changed are reloaded. All others will remain running and untouched.

This works when editing an automation in the UI, and even when reloading your
YAML-based automations in any split YAML setup you might have.

Oh, as an added bonus: We applied the exact same for scripts too!

## Getting insights into water usage

Since Home Assistant added energy management, tracking the usage of waterüö∞
has been requested quite a bit. It was [raised again during this month of WTH](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-do-we-have-energy-dashboard-and-no-water-dashboard/467168),
and with over 370 votes, it is clearly wanted a lot.

This release adds the ability to monitor your water usage in the energy dashboard!

Although water is not strictly ‚Äúenergy‚Äù, it is still a [valuable resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources)
to track. It is often tightly coupled with energy usage (like gas) when using
hot water, and the gained insight can help you reduce your ecological footprint
by using less water üåé.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-11/water-usage.png' alt='The energy dashboard now includes your water usage'>

Some integrations, like [Flo](/integrations/flo), [Flume](/integrations/flume), and
[HomeWizard Energy](/integrations/homewizard), have been adjusted to support
tracking water. Furthermore, you can create your own using templates, MQTT,
or ESPHome (requires [ESPHome version 2022.10.1](https://www.esphome.io/changelog/2022.10.0.html#release-2022-10-1-october-26) or newer).

[Check out the documentation](/docs/energy/water) for the hardware options
available to track your water usage or how to build your own water usage
sensors.

## Color temperatures in Kelvin

Another [WTH topic](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-is-light-temperature-not-in-kelvin/467449)
that was voted for almost 150 times! Why doesn't Home Assistant use Kelvin
for color temperatures?

Well, a small piece of history: The Home Assistant story started using Philips
Hue a long, long time ago. And Hue uses mired for its color temperature,
not Kelvin.

But today, Kelvin is much more commonly used. It is even on packages of the
bulbs you buy. So, as of today, Home Assistant uses Kelvin too!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-11/kelvin.png' alt='Screenshot showing the UI now uses the Kelvin unit to set the color temperature'>

Kelvin is now the primary color temperature unit. This means all lights
and everything color temperature related shown in the user interface,
are now in Kelvin.

We still do support the good old mired. Mireds are still working and
automatically converted when needed, so this is not a breaking change üéâ

Additionally, integrations can now optionally use Kelvin directly if the
device or service accepts that. [HomeKit], [Shelly],
[AVM FRITZ!SmartHome], and [LIFX] are all now using Kelvin natively.

[AVM FRITZ!SmartHome]: /integrations/fritzbox
[HomeKit]: /integrations/homekit
[LIFX]: /integrations/lifx
[Shelly]: /integrations/shelly

## Long-term statistics in the entity dialogs

The "more info" dialogs of entities now use long-term statistics for
the graphs shown. It makes those dialogs a lot faster, especially on
mobile devices.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-11/long-term-stats-more-info-dialog.png' alt='Screenshot showing you can now set the day of the week from your user profile page'>

## The first day of the week

The start of the week can differ for many of us. Your week will start on
Saturday, Sunday, or Monday based on where you are, your locale, or maybe
personal preference. As pointed out in
[this WTH topic](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-week-starts-on-sunday/468998).

Home Assistant will try to auto-detect the correct day to start the week
based on information provided by your browser. However, if it cannot detect it,
or in case you have a personal preference, you can now set it on your user profile.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-11/first-day-of-the-week.png' alt='Screenshot showing you can now set the day of the week from your user profile page'>

You can now set the day to start the week at {% my profile title="in your user profile" %}.

Setting it means that all date inputs, date range pickers, schedules, calendars,
and even time conditions in automations, will take this into account when
displaying weeks.

## New templating features

We also have some great new advanced features added to templating this release!

Originating from [this WTH topic](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-state-based-jinja-functions-are-not-filters-or-tests/468187):
You can now use the `state_attr()` and `states()` functions as a filter,
and the `is_state()` and `is_state_attr()` functions can now be used as tests.

The `average()` function now accepts a default value, which can be helpful
if no average can be calculated.

Lastly, the `config_entry_id()` template method has been added, which allows
you to look up native IDs of integration configuration entries using one
of the entities it provides.

For more information on these new features and the Home Assistant templating
capabilities in general, [check out the documentation](/docs/configuration/templating).

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- The default dashboard theme has been adjusted to move a little closer to the
  new Material Design 3 guidelines. Borders around cards are now outlined
  (instead of having a shadow), and corners are a little more rounded.
- The automations and the devices dashboards now have icons on each row, making
  them look all nice and shiny. Thanks, [@bramkragten] & [@frenck].
- The unit of measurement for entities providing Gas can now be changed and
  converted from the UI. Thanks, [@emontnemery]!
- Home Assistant is now discoverable via UPnP/SSDP, meaning your instance will
  show up in your Windows Network. Thanks, [@StevenLooman]!
- [Shelly] Gen2 devices that sleep (battery-powered) are now supported!
  Thanks, [@thecode]!
- You can now use sensors providing Gigajoule (GJ) with the energy dashboard.
  Thanks, [@emontnemery]!
- The [MQTT] integration now has support for [update entities]! Thanks, [@bieniu]!
- Media player support was added to the [Jellyfin] integration. Thanks, [@Ongy]!
- The statistics card now supports "week" as a possible period. Thanks, [@mib1185]!
- The [Sun condition] can now handle setting both before & after at the same
  time. Thanks, [@janick]!
- The "forked-daapd" project was renamed to "Owntone". The integration was now
  renamed [Owntone] too! Thanks, [@uvjustin]!
- [Fully Kiosk Browser] now provides a service to remotely change URLs on your
  wall-mounted tablet. Thanks, [@cgarwood]!
- The [Xiaomi Miio] integration now supports the Xiaomi Purifier 4 Lite and
  the Roborock S7 MaxV. Thanks, [@alexdrl] & [@starkillerOG]!
- The [UniFi] integration now provides individual PoE control per port for
  the client and device PoE (switches are disabled by default).
  Thanks, [@Kane610]!
- The [HomeKit Controller] integration now supports encrypted Bluetooth
  notifications, reducing state change latency and the number of active BLE
  connections made to devices.
- When setting up a new [Generic Camera], you will be presented with a preview
  of the camera showing you if it works. Nice! Thanks, [@davet2001]!
- Support for `unique_id`s was added to the following (YAML capable) integrations:
  - [Bayesian], added by [@HarvsG]
  - [Min/Max], added by [@gjohansson-ST]
  - [Scrape], added by [@epenet]

## Backward-incompatible changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Unit: Revolutions per minute (rpm)" %}

Multiple integrations provide sensors with the revolutions per minute unit.
Two units have been used throughout Home Assistant to indicate this:
`RPM` and `rpm`.

This release standardizes all integrations to use the lowercase `rpm` variant.
The following integrations have been adjusted:

- [Big Ass Fans](/integrations/baf)
- [Danfoss Air](/integrations/danfoss_air)
- [Glances](/integrations/glances)
- [System Bridge](/integrations/system_bridge)
- [Universal Devices ISY994](/integrations/isy994)
- [Vallox](/integrations/vallox)

Home Assistant automatically handles this change of units. However, if you
record history externally (for example, using InfluxDB), you might need to
adjust to this change.

{% details "Android IP Webcam" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Android IP Webcam
integration has been removed.

Android IP Webcam is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

integration has been removed.

Anthem A/V Receivers are now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% details "APC UPS Daemon" %}

The `UPS Last Self Test` sensor is renamed to `UPS Self Test Result` and
a new `UPS Last Self Test` sensor reports time instead of the result.

You may need to replace `sensor.ups_last_self_test` with
`sensor.ups_self_test_result` in automations and scripts
referencing the `sensor.ups_last_self_test` entity.

{% details "Brother Printer" %}

The `counter` and `remaining pages` attributes of the sensors
`drum remaining life`, `black drum remaining life`, `cyan drum remaining life`,
`magenta drum remaining life`, and `yellow drum remaining life` have been
migrated to their own dedicated sensor entities.

If you are using these attributes in your automation or script, you will need
to adopt those for this change.

{% details "ClickSend TTS" %}

- The `caller` option from `ClickSend TTS` notify service has been removed, as
  it prevented calls from being actually made.
- The default name has been changed to `clicksend_tts` instead of an empty name; otherwise
  the service would appear as `notify.notify`. Now it will, by default, appear
  as `notify.clicksend_tts`. This might impact your automation or script.
- The recipient's phone number now must match E.164 format.

{% details "Coinbase" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Coinbase
integration has been removed.

Coinbase is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% details "Dark Sky" %}

When Darksky is configured to report in US units, the unit of measurement
for precipitation intensity has been corrected from inches to inches per hour.

{% details "ecobee" %}

Setting up the `notify` platform of the ecobee integration by a platform section
using YAML configuration is no longer supported. The `ecobee` platform section
under `notify:` can be safely removed from your YAML configuration files.

The thermostat index can be specified by using the `target` parameter in the
notify service call instead.

{% details "HERE Travel Time" %}

The route sensor has been removed, as it could contain more data than
the Home Assistant state engine is able to hold. Make sure you update any
automations or scripts that use this sensor.

{% details "HomeKit" %}

HomeKit instance ID assignments are now stable between restarts to comply
with the HomeKit specifications. This prevents accessories from losing
track of services between restarts, and improves stability with using
Siri especially with apple watches.

This change may dramatically improve the stability and re-sync times of
`media_player` entities (all), `camera` entities (all), `fan` entities (presets),
`remote` entities (activity ones), `switch` entities (power strips)
 triggers (all) between restarts which was especially
 apparent when the home has many accessories.

Because the assignments were previously unstable, it may be necessary to make
a one-time adjustment of accessory room assignments, favorites,
or re-pair camera accessories after upgrading.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit Controller" %}

As older versions did not correctly set service identifier values, it may be
necessary to unpair and re-pair some BLE devices or to delete duplicate
entities manually.

If the service identifiers were loaded incorrectly when the device was paired
with an older version, operations might raise `StopIteration` or `RuntimeError`
errors. You can correct those by deleting the integration for that device,
and doing a one-time re-pairing.

{% details "Hunter Douglas PowerView" %}

This change ceases creating battery sensors for hardwired shades.
Existing sensor entities need to be manually deleted.

{% details "IntelliFire" %}

 The backing unit and the API
 of the device itself uses `0-4` as a flame height setting. Through discussion
 on the forums the community has decided `1-5` is a much more logical setting
 for flame height, and accordingly, this has been implemented.

 If you set the flame height using automations or scripts, you will  need to
 adapt those to this change.

{% details "Logger" %}

`logger` no longer changes the default log level of Home Assistant to `debug`
if used without a value for [`default`](/integrations/logger/#default). It
will now only change the default log level of Home Assistant from a
`warning` to something else if the `default` is explicitly specified.

If you do not specify `default` and want Home Assistant to have a
default log level of `debug`, you will need to add this to your YAML configuration:

```yaml
logger:
  default: debug
```

{% details "Scrape" %}

Previously, scrape would return the last correct value if an HTTP request
for updating failed. This has been adjusted to now mark the sensor
as `unavailable` instead.

Template fans no longer change their state to `on` when `set_percentage` or
`set_preset_mode` is called when a `value_template` has been configured.
