<a href='/integrations/#version/2021.5'><img src='/images/blog/2021-05/social.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

Here I am again, a month later. Are you used to these monthly release cycles
yet? Hello, 2021.5! Nice to see you this May!

I would say this release is a bit less feature rich compared to the previous
release (which was epic, in my opinion!). But it is not a bad thing!

Some really good stability improvements have been introduced this release! Not
the hot new items you want to explore immediately, but these fundamental things
will really help our systems now and in the future. Making this release an
upgrade that would be a smooth sail for most of us (check the backward-incompatible changes).

The most visual part changed this release can be found in the facelift that the
integrations dashboard got. Oh, and the new color modes for lights is an amazing
improvement as well!

May... For me, that feels like the summer is slowly trying to make its
appearance and I'm looking forward to it ðŸ•¶. Do you have a summer
Home Automation project figured out yet?

Oh, and don't forget to tune into the release party live stream later today!
(Spoiler alert: I've heard we might have a special guest, only Paulus didn't
want to tell me who it is...)

## Database upgrades & performance

There is a database upgrade in this release, but worry not as database upgrades
now happen in the background and no longer prevent Home Assistant from starting.
During migration, Home Assistant will prevent being restarted or stopped until
the migration has been completed.

Thanks to [@lmagyar] and [@raman325] we now can store events up to
64 characters and the recorder wonâ€™t get stuck if there is one exceeding that
length.

And if you have ever had to wait for the recorder to shut down, worry no more
as Home Assistant can now shut down successfully, even when the database is
broken.

Talking about broken databases: if you have ever had database corruption of
your SQLite database, you probably know how much of a pain it is to get things
back up and running again. We recently added live recovery to allow
Home Assistant to recover and start a new database when the recorder encountered
corruption when saving events or states to the database. This release extends
this live recovery to work during migration and purge. This also means no more
waiting for a database check on unclean shutdown!

Finally, the recorder performance has been improved by reducing the write
frequency.

## Startup visibility - What is taking so long?

Ever wondered why starting up Home Assistant took so long?

Stop wondering, as you can now see which integration is delaying startup as
the integration taking the longest time to set up is now displayed when
Home Assistant is starting.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2021-05/still-starting.png' alt='Screenshot of Home Assistant starting'>

</p>

And in case you missed those notifications, you can always check the
information panel afterward.

## Why Home Assistant didnâ€™t restart when I pressed the restart button?

So, why didn't Home Assistant restart when you press the restart button?
This question we have seen quite a few times and was a rather annoying
occurrence that has been improved.

The restart button now provides feedback! So you know right away if a restart
canâ€™t happen because of invalid configuration, broken integration or database
upgrade in progress.

We adjusted timeouts and fixed a few places where shutdown would block
forever, for example, when restarting Home Assistant the configuration gets
checked and there was a case that could hang in this check forever.

This means restarts are faster now! As more parts of Home Assistant now
cancel/react to the shutdown procedure better than before
(from the Month of [What the Heck][wth]).

We also audited the top 35 integrations to make sure they stop polling on stop.
Thanks for {% my general title="turning on analytics" %}!

## Updated look and feel for the integration dashboard

The {% my integrations title="Integrations dashboard" %} has been updated to
have a more compact look and provide more useful information.

For example, it now shows the state of the integration and in case of a
failure, it will now tell you why that is.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2021-05/integrations-dashboard.png' alt='Screenshot of the updated integrations dashboard'>
Screenshot of the updated integrations dashboard.
</p>

Additionally, you can now recognize integrations that rely on the cloud
(they show a little cloud label) and integrations that are installed as
custom integration (they show a little package label).

## Color modes!

We now have support for RGBWW, RGBW and many more color modes!

Previously, we relied mainly on HS (Hue Saturation) & Brightness (HSB/HSV)
and colors in Home Assistant was based on that. But now, an integration can
provide the actual color mode an light supports. This allows Home Assistant
(and integrations) to adjust the behavior for the light better.

For example, the frontend will adjust the color picker based on the color mode
of the light. The more info dialog for lights have been modernized to support
this change:

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2021-05/rgbww-light.png' alt='Screenshot of the updated more info dialog for lights'>
Screenshot of the updated more info dialog for lights.
</p>

Please note, that at this moment not all integrations are able to support color
modes yet. However, all lights do have an nice updated UI as in the screenshot.

## Trigger-based binary template sensor

In the [previous release][previous], we introduced a trigger-based template
sensor. This release extends on that features by adding support for
trigger-based binary sensors using templates.

Trigger-based binary sensors can also be configured with an `auto_off` duration.
This will automatically turn a binary sensor state to `off` after the specified
duration.

{% raw %}

```yaml
template:
  - trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: netatmo_event
        event_data:
          type: movement
    binary_sensor:
      - name: "Motion"
        # We use auto_off, so just set it to true on each trigger
        state: "true"
        device_class: motion
        # Automatically turn off 60 seconds after the last event
        auto_off: 60
```

{% endraw %}

Some other ideas:

- [Store webhook information in Home Assistant](/integrations/template/#storing-webhook-information)
- One that updates based on a time trigger once a day
  (e.g., "Is is my birthday?" binary sensor).

[previous]: /blog/2021/04/07/release-20214/#trigger-based-template-sensors

## Docker images now signed and available on the GitHub Container Registry

We are now using both DockerHub and the new GitHub Container Registry.

If you want to use the new GitHub Container Registry, just use:

`ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant`

(Instead of `homeassistant/home-assistant`)

Our core images are now also signed with [CodeNotary](https://codenotary.io)
and allowing you to check the integrity of our images.

CodeNotary is a distributed Ledger solution using the
[immudb](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb) as a database for built-in
cryptographic proof and verification.

If you are running the Home Assistant Operating System or a Supervised
installation type, we already check the integrity of our distributed content.
If you running the Container installation, you can install the
[VCN](https://github.com/codenotary/vcn) tool.

Now you can use it like so:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:2021.5.0
vcn authenticate --org home-assistant.io docker://ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:2021.5.0
```

This will tell/confirm that the image you have, is actually created
and shipped by the Home Assistant project.

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- Are you in meetings a lot? The new [mutesync][mutesync docs] integration
  shows if you're in a meeting and if you're muted in Home Assistant. This will
  unlock some cool do-not-disturb automations.
- We did an audit of memory leaks and fixed a couple of generic cases in our
  core codebase. But also fixed over 15 cases during unload/reload in popular
  integrations.
- The TTS service by Home Assistant Cloud now uses an improved bitrate,
  making it sound even more impressive.
- ClimaCell now supports the v4 API. So, If you've wanted to test it out you
  can now actually use it with the new API keys. Thanks [@raman325]!
- If you are into templating, we now have `min()` and `max()` available
  as functions in Jinja templates.
- The AdGuard integration now supports multiple instances thanks to [@eifinger].
- When viewing your logs in the frontend, the log entry will tell you if
  the log was created by a custom integration.
- If you have a Sonos Move or Sonos Roam, you can now see their battery level
  and charging state. Thanks for that [@hufman] and [@jjlawren].
- Template covers now can have an opening and closing state, which was added by
  [@bdr99], thanks for that!
- The ZHA integration now has configuration options in the UI, allowing you
  to set things like default transition times for your lights.
  Thanks [@dmulcahey]!
- The Z-Wave JS integration now allows you to re-interview a device from the
  UI thanks to [@cgarwood].
- [@cgarwood] didn't stop there, you can now opt-in for sending Z-Wave JS
  telemetry to the Z-Wave JS project to help them out. This can be turned
  on in the Z-Wave JS configuration panel.

## Backward-incompatible changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Container udev" %}

We no longer run an udev instance inside our containers. This was used by the
Supervisor which now is using the host udev in all containers.

For now, we have a fallback environment variable `USING_UDEV=1` which you can
set on your container to get the old behavior. This gives you time for using
the Docker way to map/use devices.

If you run a system that uses the Supervisor, this is automatically taken
care of.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Custom integrations" %}

Custom integrations now require a version key in their manifest file, this also
means that all custom integrations now require a manifest file.

If you are using a legacy custom integration like `custom_components/awesome.py`
this now needs to move to `custom_components/awesome/__init__.py` so you can
add `custom_components/awesome/manifest.json` to it.

For more information about integration, manifests have a look here:
<https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_manifest>

Custom integrations that do not have this will be blocked from loading if
itâ€™s missing a version in the manifest starting with Home Assistant 2021.6.

If you see these errors, please report the issue with the author of that
custom integration.

([@ludeeus] - [#49726])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Events" %}

An event fired with an `event_type` of more than 64 characters would previously
result in recorder errors but the event would otherwise work. Now, firing an
event with more than 64 characters in the event type will raise immediately.

If you are using long events in your automations or scripts, you should adjust
to this change. Custom integration authors should review their event types.

([@raman325] - [#48115])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ASUSWRT" %}

The `device_tracker` entity state attribute `ip_address` has been changed and is
now be named `ip`. You need to update automations and scripts that use this
attribute.

([@bieniu] - [#48764])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!Box Tools" %}

The AVM FRITZ!Box Tools integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

([@chemelli74] - [#48287])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!SmartHome" %}

YAML configuration for AVM FRITZ!SmartHome has been removed, after it has been
deprecated for 12 months. Configuration via UI is fully integrated. Existing
YAML configuration has already been imported automatically in the previous
releases and can now safely be removed from your configuration files.

([@mib1185] - [#49663])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DHT Sensor" %}

The `pin` configuration option is currently an integer but will need to be
prefixed with D for Raspberry Pi platforms.

Please adjust your YAML configuration for this change.

([@TheGardenMonkey] - [#41525])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ecobee" %}

ecobee climate devices will change the reported temperature precision for their
`current_temperature` attribute from whole degrees to 0.1 degree increments.
Automations which rely on whole-number precision may need adjustments.

([@jjlawren] - [#48697])

Setting a fan hold in the ecobee integration will no longer also set a
temperature hold. If any automations assumed that the temperature would be set
when calling the set_fan_mode service on an ecobee device, those automations
will need to add the appropriate `set_temperature` service call.

([@bjpetit] - [#48086])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Enphase Envoy" %}

Enphase Envoy has fully transitioned to configuration via UI. YAML configuration
will be removed in an upcoming version. Existing YAML configuration will be
imported automatically, and can now safely be removed from your configuration
files.

All sensors are now configured by default. Each inverter has a unique ID and
can now be disabled in the UI.

([@bdraco] - [#48517])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ezviz" %}

The Ezviz integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

All camera state attributes were removed and replaced by binary_sensors,
sensors or switches.

List of old camera state attributes with their new replacements:

- "privacy": switch entity, camera_name.privacy
- "audio": switch entity, camera_name.sound
- "ir_led": switch entity, camera_name.infrared
- "state_led": switch entity, camera_name.light
- "follow_move": switch entity, camera_name.tracking
- "alarm_notify": camara status, "Recording"
- "alarm_sound_mod": sensor, camera_name.alarm_sound_mod
- "encrypted": binary_sensor, camera_name.encrypted
- "local_ip": sensor, camera_name.local_ip
- "detection_sensibility": sensor, camera_name.detection_sensibility

If you are using one of these attributes in your automations or scripts, you
will need to adjust to this change.

([@RenierM26] - [#45722])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Garmin Connect" %}
The unit of measurement from Garmin Connect timestamp sensors has been removed.
It used to be set to empty string. If you have automations, scripts or external
data recvorder that rely on unit of measurement for these sensors, you might
need to adjust to this change.

([@MartinHjelmare] - [#48431])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "GNTP (Growl)" %}

The GNTP (Growl) integration has been deprecated and is going to be removed in
Home Assistant Core 2021.6.

The Growl project has now fully retired, see: <https://growl.github.io/growl/>

([@frenck] - [#49273])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Travel Time" %}

The Google Travel Time integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

([@raman325] - [#43509])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hive" %}

The existing Hive service `heating_boost` will be deprecated in Home Assistant
release 2021.6 and a new service to replace it has been created called
`heating_boost_on`.

If you use the `heating_boost` Hive service please update your configuration
to the new service. A deprecation warning will be printed to the logs when the
deprecated service is used.

([@KJonline] - [#48701])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "KNX" %}

The `config_file` YAML option for KNX was deprecated before and has now been
removed.

([@marvin-w] - [#48799])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Light profiles" %}

When a light entity has a default profile associated, the default profile will
only be applied for the `light.turn_on` service call when the light state is
off or no data is sent with the service call.

The transition attribute from the default profile in `light_profiles.csv` will
also be applied when `light.turn_off` is called.

([@karliemeads] - [#49376]) ([light docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Litter-Robot" %}

`reset_waste_drawer`, `set_sleep_mode`, and `set_wait_time` now have their own
services. Previously, they were triggered by using `send_command`.
If you used any of those commands in your automations or scripts, you'll need
to replace them with their service counter-part.

([@natekspencer] - [#48300])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

A new option `SWAP` replaces `REVERSE_ORDER`, however `REVERSE_ORDER` is
still accepted and silently converted to `SWAP=WORD`.

Note: `REVERSE_ORDER` will be removed in a future release.

Old configuration example:

```yaml
modbus:
  sensors:
    - name: "sensor1"
      address: 17
      reverse_order: true
      ...
   - name: "sensor2"
      address: 17
      reverse_order: false
      ...
```

New configuration example:

```yaml
modbus:
  sensors:
    - name: "sensor1"
      address: 17
      swap: word
      ...
   - name: "sensor2"
      address: 17
      swap: none
      ...
```

Swap allows `none`/`byte`/`word`/`word_byte` options.

([@janiversen] - [#49719])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Recollect Waste" %}

Recollect Waste pickup dates are now stored as UTC timestamps.

([@bachya] - [#48690])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Recorder" %}

Database migrations are now done in the background and no longer prevent
Home Assistant from starting.

The migration is started shortly after the started event since they are CPU
intensive (mostly just sqlite since it's in the same process) and we do not want
to compete with startup.

Events created by your system are queued and processed when the migration is
completed. There is a safety to start discarding events if more than ~30000
events happen before migration is completed to avoid memory exhaustion.

During migration, Home Assistant will prevent being started or stopped and
this will also disable the `homeassistant.stop` and `homeassistant.start`
services until the migration has been completed.

The sqlite database recovery logic can now recover at point after setup
including purge, migration, and event insert. In short we can _always_
(hopefully) recover and start a new db without a restart.

The quick check is no longer performed on unclean shutdown since we can always
recover live. The `db_integrity_check` option has been deprecated.

([@bdraco] - [#49036] [#49098])

If you are using a PostgreSQL database please verify that your connection URL starts with `postgresql://`. In case you use still an old URL starting with `postgres://`, please replace it with `postgresql://` otherwise you will get an error to set up the recorder.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "RoonLabs music player" %}

The RoonLabs music player `media_player` previously had integration specific
services for `roon.join` and `roon.un_join`. These have been removed removes
and replaced with the `media_player.join` and `media_player.unjoin` services.

If you use these services in your automations or script, you need to adjust those.

([@pavoni] - [#49667])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Shelly" %}

The Shelly Wi-Fi RSSI sensor unit was wrong, it is **dBm** and not **dB**.
If you rely on the unit of measurement from this sensor, you might need to
adjust to this change.

([@thecode] - [#49265])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SimpliSafe" %}

The unpublished SimpliSafe cloud API no longer provides a functioning websocket.
Therefore, the integration will no longer be able to receive `SIMPLISAFE_EVENT`
or `SIMPLISAFE_NOTIFICATION` events, nor will it be possible for stage changes
performed outside of Home Assistant (e.g., via the keypad) to be reflected in
Home Assistant in near-realtime.

([@bachya] - [#49876]) ([simplisafe docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SMA Solar" %}

The SMA integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring the integration
via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is automatically
imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

Using custom sensors is deprecated and not possible using the UI. Feel free to
submit additional sensors to be added as standard sensors to the
[pysma library](https://github.com/kellerza/pysma/blob/master/pysma/__init__.py#L100).

The `pv_power` sensor is now reporting DC power of solar panels side A and named `pv_power_a` for new installations. `grid_power` is the total power supplied to the grid.

([@rklomp] - [#48003])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Sure Petcare" %}

The following YAML configuration options have been deprecated:

- `feeders`
- `flaps`
- `pets`
- `scan_interval`

If you have one of these options in your YAML configuration, you can safely
remove those.

([@benleb] - [#49223])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Swiss Hydrological Data" %}

FEON/BAFU changed their data which required removing some of the attributes.

The following attributes are no longer available:

- delta-24h
- max-1h
- min-1h
- mean-1h
- previous-24h

([@Bouni] - [#49119])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "System Monitor" %}

The unit of measurement from System Monitor timestamp sensors has been removed.
It used to be set to empty string. If you have automations, scripts or external
data recorder that rely on unit of measurement for these sensors, you might
need to adjust to this change.

([@MartinHjelmare] - [#48431])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Tasmota" %}

Tasmota lights no longer supports deprecated `white_value`, use `rgbw_color`
instead.

([@emontnemery] - [#49599]) ([tasmota docs])

The Tasmota Wi-Fi RSSI sensor unit was wrong, it is **dBm** and not **dB**.
If you rely on the unit of measurement from this sensor, you might need to
adjust to this change.

([@thecode] - [#49263]) ([tasmota docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Waze Travel Time" %}

The Waze Travel Time integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

([@raman325] - [#43419])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ZeroConf" %}

If the `default_interface` is not set, the value is auto-detected based on the
system routing next hop for the mDNS broadcast address (`224.0.0.251`).

If the next-hop cannot be detected or is a loopback address, `zeroconf` will
broadcast on all interfaces. If the next hop is a non-loopback address,
`zeroconf` will only broadcast on the default interface.

Setting the `default_interface` to `true` or `false` will override the auto
detection.

([@bdraco] - [#49529])

{% enddetails %}

## Farewell to the following

The following integrations are no longer available as of this release:

- **Geizhals** has been removed. ([@frenck] - [#48594])
- **Social Blade** has been removed. ([@frenck] - [#48677])

Both integrations were in a broken state and using webscaping methods to gather
their data, which is not allowed for core integrations.
