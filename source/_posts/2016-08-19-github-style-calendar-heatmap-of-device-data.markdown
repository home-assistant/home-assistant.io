Thanks to [Anton Kireyeu](https://github.com/kireyeu) we are able to present another awesome [Jupyter notebook]. I guess that you all know the graph which Github is using to visualize your commits per day over a time-line. It's a so-called [heatmap]. If there are more commits, it's getting hotter. The latest [notebook][nb-prev] is capable to do the same thing for your devices. To be more precise, for the hours your devices are home.
