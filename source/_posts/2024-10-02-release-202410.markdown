Boo! ðŸ‘»

Please donâ€™t be scared; it is October, Halloween is coming, and so is the next
Home Assistant release:Â 2024.10! ðŸŽƒ

The release we bring you today is a perfect mix of new UI features, advanced
features, improvements, and lots of bug fixes while not being too overwhelming.
There is something for everyone in this release.

Most notably, we have a brand new heading card. It allows you to add titles or
subtitles to your dashboards, make them clickable, and even add cute little
entities to them. The new section dashboard gets better and better with every
release, which is super exciting!

We also introduce some small YAML automation syntax changes. If you are still
a sucker for writing your automations in {% term YAML %} (like me), Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll love
these little tweaks that make it all feel more natural.

Enjoy the release!

## Heading in the right direction

Update after update, [Sections] continues to become a customization powerhouse,
and this month is no exception. Section titles are replaced with their own card,
called the [heading card]. Making them a card rather than an inline title gives
you a lot more flexibility, allowing you to put them nearly anywhere.

The heading card can be used to make titles, but also subtitles, which are half
the height and have smaller, lighter text. So, if you have ever had a section
that needs to be subdivided, slap a subtitle in there.

![Screenshot showing a dashboard using heading cards with titles and subtitles](/images/blog/2024-10/headings.png)

Titles and subtitles can be made clickable, displaying a chevron
{% icon "mdi:chevron-right" %} when you can interact with them.Â This can
perform an action or navigate to a subpage, like having an energy section title
navigate to the full energy dashboard.

Best of all, if you've already added titles to your sections, they will be
migrated automatically to the new card. ðŸ˜Ž

[heading card]: /dashboards/heading/

### Another headline feature

We had such a fantastic reaction when we released our [renewed badges],
and this new heading card has something very similar and equally as visually
appealing. It can show multiple entity states to the right of the title or
subtitle.

![Screenshot showing a dashboard with additional entities shown on card headings](/images/blog/2024-10/heading-with-entities.png)

Either in a subtle "no color" default or add a splash of color when the entity
is in an active state. Other customization options for these entities include
changing the icon, visibility, and what happens when you select it.

## Repairs for long-term statistics

[Long-term statistics] are great; they downsample and store the data produced
by your {% term sensors %}, allowing Home Assistant to store data indefinitely
in a fraction of the space the original readings took up. Take a look back at
[your energy usage] from two years ago, or see if your living room really is
colder this year compared to last.

![Screenshot showing a long-term statistic repair showing up in the settings menu](/images/blog/2024-10/statistics-repair.jpg)

In the past, if a statistic encountered an issue, it might be quietly broken
until you dig into the statistics page. Now, Home Assistant will raise a repair
notification when it detects issues with a long-term statistic and give
you options for fixing the issue.

## Improved YAML syntax for automations

Recently, we renamed `service` to `action` in the [Home Assistant UI and YAML].
This was done with the goal of making the syntax more natural, allowing it
to be easier to grasp and read. We want to continue this work to improve the
{% term YAML %} syntax, this time focusing on {% term automations %}, and we've made the
following changes,

- The top-level `trigger` key is now `triggers` (plural)
- The top-level `condition` key is now `conditions` (plural)
- The top-level `action` key is now `actions` (plural)
- The `platform` key of a trigger definition is now `trigger`

The result of all this is that YAML automation syntax now has `triggers` with
multiple `trigger` definitions, `conditions` with multiple `condition`
definitions, and `actions` with multiple `action` definitions.

Here is a small example of an automation highlighting these changes.

<p class="img">
<img src="/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-automation-syntax-changes.png" alt="Screenshots; left showing the old automation YAML style, right showing the new style. The differences between them have been highlighted.">
The 2024.9 release on the left and this 2024.10 release on the right.
</p>

As with the other syntax changes we've done recently, this is
**not a breaking change**, and there will be no deprecation. The previous syntax
will continue to work, and there are no plans to remove the old syntax. The new
syntax is recommended, and all documentation and examples have been updated.
Automations managed by the automation editor will automatically be migrated to
the new syntax when saving an automation.

This is not the only change to our syntax, thanks to [@karwosts] we now support
[merging a list of triggers], which is mostly useful for
{% term blueprint %} authors.

[merging a list of triggers]: /docs/automation/trigger/#merging-lists-of-triggers
[Home Assistant UI and YAML]: /blog/2024/08/07/release-20248/#goodbye-service-calls-hello-actions-

## Faster upgrades when using custom integrations

We want Home Assistant to continue to work on a wide range of hardware. If you
look at our [opt-in analytics] you'll see a sizable amount of homes running it
on single-board computers from the mid-2010s. A lot of effort has been put into
keeping Home Assistant lean, and this release has some good improvements. This
is specially for users of custom integrations, and this follows HACS getting a
great [speed boost for downloads].

On each upgrade, all dependencies needed for {% term "custom integrations" %}
are now downloaded and installed. We are now using `uv` internally to download
and install dependencies, which is a faster and more efficient way to download
and install dependencies. If you're not aware, `uv` is what makes our release
process so fast nowadays, and [@edenhaus] has done an interesting
[developer backstory] on our move from `pip` to `uv` (saving us 200+ hours
of execution time a month). [@edenhaus] has also implemented `uv` at runtime
as well.

This speeds up the upgrade process, especially for custom integrations with many
dependencies, or installations with many custom integrations. This change is
fully transparent to the user, and no action is required. Just sit down, relax,
and enjoy the faster upgrade process!

### Noteworthy improvements to existing integrations

It is not just new {% term integrations %} that have been added; existing
integrations are also being constantly improved. Here are some of the noteworthy
changes to existing integrations:

- [@Bre77] has been busy with the [Tesla Fleet] integration, adding a bunch of
  new features and entities to control your Tesla vehicle. It now supports
  climate, media player, cover, number, select, button, and lock entities.
- You can now control the volume, ringtone, and status light of your [Reolink]
  Hub! Cool, [@starkillerOG]!
- [@daniel-k] added support for controlling the volume and [@sdb9696] added a
  switch for controlling motion detection on [Ring] devices; Nice work team!
- The [Switchbot Cloud] integration now supports the [K10+ Mini Robot Vacuum].
  Thanks, [@Gigatrappeur]!
- [@sorgfresser] extended the [ElevenLabs] integration with integration options
  to control the voice settings. Nice!
- The [Squeezebox (Lyrion Music Server)] integration now has new service sensors,
  and support for  your favorites straight from the media browser.
  Thanks, [@pssc] and [@rajlaud]!
- [@tronikos] added [Google Cloud] speech-to-text (STT) to Home Assistant. This
  allows you to use Google's Cloud speech-to-text with [Assist]! Awesome!
- If you are using the [Husqvarna Automower], you can now view the calendar
  it provides, thanks to [@Thomas55555]!
- [@klaasnicolaas] added support for home batteries to the [Autarco]
  integration so you can use them in your energy dashboard. Great!

### Now available to set up from the UI

While most {% term integrations %} can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.

The following integrations are now available via the Home Assistant UI:

- **[Emoncms]**, done by [@alexandrecuer]
- **[Google Cloud Platform]**, done by [@tronikos]
- **[HTML5 Push Notifications]**, done by [@alexyao2015]
- **[Mold Indicator]**, done by [@gjohansson-ST]

## Matter

At this point, our [Matter integration] is almost becoming a monthly recurring
topic in our release notes. For a good reason! The development is moving forward
at a strong pace; running toward the certification finish line!

<center><img src='/images/supported_brands/matter.png' alt='Matter logo' class='no-shadow'></center><br>

In terms of stability, we have improved the robustness of the integration to
ensure it sets up correctly every time, even if an issue with one
of your devices occurs. Besides the usual bugfixes and improvements, this
release has some cool new features and additions:

- **Button entities**  
  New button entities that allow you to perform an action on a device. For
  example, to identify a device or reset the filter state.
- **Valve entities**  
  Support for water valves, allowing you to control the flow of fluids or gases.
- **Support for operation states**  
  Control and monitor the operation state of, for example, dishwashers
  and other household equipment.
- **Support for smoke and CO sensors**  
  Monitor the air quality in your home with smoke and CO sensors.
- **Add support for Matter 1.3 power/energy sensors**  
  Especially the energy sensors are great to use with the energy dashboard.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- In June, we added support for adding [Model IDs to devices]. This release
  has lots of integrations that add them, including [Matter], [Plugwise],
  [Wallbox], and [Govee]. We are calling for contributions to add model IDs to
  more integrations! Maybe a cool suggestion for an [Hacktoberfest] contribution!
- [@bmesuere] improved the accessibility of all graphs by adjusting all the
  default colors used in those graphs! You are a hero!
- When you unignore an integration or device on the integrations page,
  Home Assistant will instantly try to rediscover it again! Nice! Thanks,
  [@emontnemery]!
- We now have a new unit of measurement for energy entities: calories. Useful,
  for devices like a treadmill or an exercise bike. Thanks, [@dudanov]!
- [@TrevorSchirmer] did something similar, and added a new unit of speed:
  mm/s and in/s. Thank you!
- When you rename a device, you will now see more details about the rename
  operation. Including a preview of the new entity IDs. Nice, [@karwosts]!
- [@gjohansson-ST] added a new template function [`merge_response`] that
  allows you to merge multiple responses of a single action or multiple actions
  into a single response. Nice!
- [Trigger-based templates] now have support for adding conditions! Just like
  automations, you can now add conditions to these entities to control when
  they are rendered. Thanks, [@chammp]! 
- More template fun! You can now set up your templated alarm control panel
  straight from the UI. Thanks, [@gjohansson-ST]!
- The statistics developer tools have been improved. They now have the new-style
  data tables and the ability to bulk select items to action. Awesome [@karwosts]!
- There is a new entity in town, the [`assist satellite` entity](/integrations/assist_satellite/).
  It is a building block for remote satellites devices that use [Assist]. This
  is in preparation for our upcoming satellite hardware. Stay tuned!

### The source of a repair

{% term Integrations %} can raise issues in your repairs dashboard, they can
raise issues for themselves, but also for other integrations. An example of
such an issue is an integration that connects to your device that raises an
issue on an {% term automation %} that controls it.

The result is an automation issue in your repair center. This is cool, but
you might want to know which integration raised the issue in the first place.

Thanks to [@wendevlin], we now show the source integration of the repair issue
in the issue dialog.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-10/repair-issue-reported-by.png" alt="Screenshot showing the new repairs dialog reporting the integration that raised it.">

[@wendevlin]: https://github.com/wendevlin

### YAML-editor improvements

[@naps62] has been busy improving the YAML editor found in the Home Assistant
user interface.

We now have a vertical line based on indentation, which makes it easier to see
the indentation of your YAML configuration and allows you to spot and prevent
indentation errors.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/blog/2024-10/YAML-editor-improvements.png" alt="Screenshot showing the YAML editor with collapsed sections and the vertical indentation line.">

But he didnâ€™t stop there. You can now collapse and expand sections of your
YAML configuration based on the indentation level; which is also demonstrated
in the screenshot above.

Nice work [@naps62]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Climate" %}

We have added more validation to the `climate.set_humidity` action, which
enforces that the set target humidity is within the targeted entity's minimum
and maximum humidity levels.

You should adjust automations and scripts to use valid values if you are using
this action.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125242]) ([documentation](/integrations/climate))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125242]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125242

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ecobee" %}

The previously deprecated `aux_heat` attribute has been removed from the
provided climate entity.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125246]) ([documentation](/integrations/ecobee))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125246]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125246

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Honeywell Total Connect Comfort (US)" %}

The previously deprecated `aux_heat` attribute has been removed from the
provided climate entity.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125248]) ([documentation](/integrations/honeywell))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125248]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125248

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Humidifier" %}

We have added more validation to the `humidifier.set_humidity` action, which
enforces that the target humidity is within the targeted entity's minimum
and maximum humidity levels.

You might need to adjust automations and scripts to use valid values if you
are using this action.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125863]) ([documentation](/integrations/humidifier))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125863]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125863

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nuki" %}

The previously deprecated `nuki_id` and `battery_critical` attributes have
been removed from the Nuki entities. If you are using these attributes in
automations or scripts, you need to update those.

([@steffenrapp] - [#125348]) ([documentation](/integrations/nuki))

[@steffenrapp]: https://github.com/steffenrapp
[#125348]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125348

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenTherm Gateway" %}

To modernize the OpenTherm Gateway integration, all entities have been split
into different devices. As a result, the OpenTherm Gateway climate entity
has been moved to a new OpenTherm Thermostat device.

Configurations that look for the climate entity by device must be adjusted
accordingly.

In the process, all entities were reviewed and some were found to be irrelevant
or superfluous. These entities have been removed. All removed entities were
previously disabled by default, so anyone who has never manually enabled an
entity in the OpenTherm Gateway integration is not affected by this.

All other users should review their configuration for using OpenTherm Gateway

{% details "Ping" %}

The binary sensor attributes this integration provided have been
replaced with sensor entities in Home Assistant 2024.4. These deprecated
attributes have now been removed.

{% details "Squeezebox (Lyrion Music Server)" %}

We previously noticed that the squeezebox platform had deprecated
the `squeezebox_sync` and `squeezebox_unsync` actions and the `sync_group`
entity attribute in favor of the newer "join" framework common to all
media players.

These deprecated actions and entity attributes have now been removed.

{% details "Templates" %}

Limit maximum template render output to 256KiB to ensure template renders
do not inject unreasonable data into the system and cause a crash.

256KiB is likely to still block Home Assistantâ€™s event loop for an unreasonable
amount of time, but it's likely someone is using the template engine for large
blocks of data, so we want a limit that still allows that but has a reasonable
safety margin to prevent the system from crashing down.
