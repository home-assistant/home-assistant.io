{% note %}

**Welcome to the beta release notes for Home Assistant 2024.10** üéâ

<br />

Please note that these release notes are a work in progress. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We will be
completing them over the next couple of days. Not all features might be final
yet, and some features _**may not** make it into the final release_.

<br />

**Want to help test the beta?** Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è We have documented how you
[can join our beta channel and install the beta here](/common-tasks/os/#running-a-beta-version).

<br />

While running the beta, we highly recommend joining our _#beta_ channel on
the [Home Assistant Discord chat](/join-chat)! üí¨ Most developers and beta
testers are in this channel during the beta period to share experiences, ideas,
and iterate over new features, fine-tuning them before the final release.
It's a really fun place to hang out. üòé

<br />

**Reporting issues**: As this is a beta test, you might encounter unexpected
behavior or issues. üêû We use the GitHub issue tracker to track beta issues.
You can find our issue trackers and the reported issues during beta here:

<br />

- [Report(ed) beta **dashboards/UI/frontend** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/milestone/124)
- [Report(ed) beta **integrations/automations/backend/core** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/milestone/695)
- [Report(ed) beta **documentation** issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/milestone/131)

üôè When reporting issues, **make sure to mention the exact beta version you are
running** in the issue description. This will help us identify and track the
issue correctly. Read more about [reporting issues here](/help/reporting_issues/).

<br />

Issues introduced in the beta are processed with priority. üîù

## Heading in the right direction

New header card! This section can possibily use some examples and
be split into multiple subsections.

Gist:
  - Replaces the headings of sections, which are automatically migrated on upgrade.
  - Two types of headers: Header and Subheader.
  - You can add multiple (sub)header cards to a section.
  - A heading can have an action, for example a link to a more detailed view
  - Heading cards can have entities, that are shown in the top right of the header
  - The display of these entities can be customized:
    - Color; default they have a text color, but can be color to the state color of the entity used, or by providing a custom color for an active state.
    - Default to icon + state, but what is hows, can be fully customized.
    - Can be shown conditionally, using the visibility options

Headers and subheaders with entities:

Ability to select the entity color behavior:

![CleanShot 2024-09-24 at 17 41 16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32231d3d-748a-47c2-82b1-aff401ffa388)

Result with custom colors:

![CleanShot 2024-09-24 at 14 25 24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9075e6b6-6773-4d58-8ede-3d0447c5f6aa)

## Repairs for long term statistics

We now raise repair issue when Home Assistant detects issues with a long term
statistic.

Gist:
  - Previously only available via developer tools
  - Was a bit hidden, causing people not to be aware of issues
  - No we raise repair issue for the ones that need a decision.

## Improved YAML syntax for automations

Improvements to the YAML-sytnax for automations.
Gist:
  - Follow up on the `service` to `action` rename/change 2 releases ago.
  - The top level `trigger` key is now `triggers` (plural)
  - The top level `condition` key is now `conditions` (plural)
  - The top level `action` key is now `actions` (plural)
  - The `platform` key of a trigger definition is now `trigger`
  - Result: The YAML automation syntax now has `triggers` with multiple `trigger` definitions, `conditions` with multiple `condition` definitions, and `actions` with multiple `action` definitions. This makes it consistent and easier to read.
  - Not a breaking change, no deprecation. Existing syntax will continue to work and there are no plans to remove the old syntax.
  - The new syntax is recommended, and all documentation and examples have been updated to use the new syntax.
  - Automated managed by the automation editor, will automatically be migrated to the new syntax when saving an automation.

```yaml
# Automation example:
alias: "My automation"
description: "This is my automation"
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: light.kitchen
    to: "on"
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.motion
    state: "on"
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

Additonal bonus (or noteworthy maybe) we also support nested triggers now:

```yaml
triggers:
  - triggers:
    - trigger: state
      entity_id: light.kitchen
      to: "on"
```

This is mainly useful for blueprint authors, but can be used by users to group triggers together as well.

## Faster upgrades when using custom integrations

Bit of a technical item, still cool.

Gist:
  - On each upgrade, all dependencies needed for custom integrations are downloaded and installed. 
  - We are now using `uv` internally to download and install dependencies. It is a faster and more efficient way to download and install dependencies.
  - `uv` is what makes our release process so fast nowadays, [developer backstory](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/04/03/build-images-with-uv/)
  - This speeds up the upgrade process, especially for custom integrations with many dependencies or installation with many custom integrations.
  - This change is fully transparent to the user, and no action is required.
  - Just sit down, relax, and enjoy the faster upgrade process!
  - Use uv at runtime too ([@edenhaus] - [#125110])

### The source of an repair

Integrations can raise issues in your repairs dashboard, they can raise issues
for themselves, but also for other integrations. An example of such an issue,
is an integration that connects to your device that raises an issue on an
automation that controls it.

The result, is an automation issue in your repair center. This is cool, but
you might want to know which integration raised the issue in the first place.

Thanks to [@wendevlin], we now show the source integration of the repair issue
in the issue dialog.

### YAML-editor improvements

[@naps62] has been busy improving the YAML editor we show in the user interface
of Home Assistant.

We now have a indention-based vertical line, making it easier to see the
indentation of your YAML configuration, making it easier to spot and prevent
indentation errors.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2254e0b-98ca-46b0-874f-0420c60d3626)

But he didn't stop there, you can now also collapse and expand sections of your
YAML configuration based on the indentation level.

![CleanShot 2024-09-25 at 13 19 19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c14fa4bc-fac2-4c40-9f26-ec5aa9d8cf62)

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Climate" %}

We have added more validation to the `climate.set_humidity` action which
enforces that the set target humidity is within the min and max humidity
levels of the targeted entity.

You might need to adjust automations and scripts to use valid values if you
are using this action.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125242]) ([documentation](/integrations/climate))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125242]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125242

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ecobee" %}

The previously deprecated `aux_heat` attribute has been removed from the
provided climate entity.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125246]) ([documentation](/integrations/ecobee))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125246]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125246

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Honeywell Total Connect Comfort (US)" %}

The previously deprecated `aux_heat` attribute has been removed from the
provided climate entity.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125248]) ([documentation](/integrations/honeywell))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125248]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125248

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Humidifier" %}

We have added more validation to the `humidifier.set_humidity` action, which
enforces that the set target humidity is within the min and max humidity
levels of the targeted entity.

You might need to adjust automations and scripts to use valid values if you
are using this action.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125863]) ([documentation](/integrations/humidifier))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125863]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125863

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nexia/American Standard/Trane" %}

The `aux_heat` attribute of the climate entity is now deprecated and will be
removed in Home Assistant 2025.4.0. Use the newly provided emergency heat
switch entity instead.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#125250]) ([documentation](/integrations/nexia))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#125250]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125250

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nuki" %}

The previously deprecated `nuki_id` and `battery_critical` attributes have
been removed from the Nuki entities. If you are using these attributes in
automations or scripts, you need to update those.

([@steffenrapp] - [#125348]) ([documentation](/integrations/nuki))

[@steffenrapp]: https://github.com/steffenrapp
[#125348]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125348

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenTherm Gateway" %}

In order to modernize the OpenTherm Gateway integration, all entities have
been split into different devices. As a result, the OpenTherm Gateway climate
entity has been moved to a new OpenTherm Thermostat device.

Configurations that look for the climate entity by device must be adjusted
accordingly.

In the process, all entities were reviewed and some were found to be irrelevant
or superfluous. These entities have been removed. All removed entities were
previously disabled by default, so anyone who has never manually enabled an
entity in the OpenTherm Gateway integration is not affected by this.

All other users should review their configuration for the use of OpenTherm
Gateway entities that no longer exist or that have been assigned to another
device.

([@mvn23] - [#124869]) ([documentation](/integrations/opentherm_gw))

[@mvn23]: https://github.com/mvn23
[#124869]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/124869

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

Support for use of an area, device, or entity as a target for ScreenLogic
actions has been removed. Instead, use `config_entry` with the
`entry_id` of the desired ScreenLogic

([@dieselrabbit] - [#123432]) ([documentation](/integrations/screenlogic))

[@dieselrabbit]: https://github.com/dieselrabbit
[#123432]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/123432

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ping" %}

The binary sensor attributes this integration provided have been
replaced with sensor entities in Home Assistant 2024.4. These deprecated
attributes have now been removed.

([@jpbede] - [#125760]) ([documentation](/integrations/ping))

[@jpbede]: https://github.com/jpbede
[#125760]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125760

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ring" %}

The `ring.update` action was deprecated in the 2024.4 release and now has
been removed. Please use `homeassistant.update_entity` if you need
a replacement.

([@jpbede] - [#125762]) ([documentation](/integrations/ring))

[@jpbede]: https://github.com/jpbede
[#125762]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125762

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Squeezebox (Lyrion Music Server)" %}

We previously gave notice that the squeezebox platform had deprecated
the `squeezebox_sync` and `squeezebox_unsync` actions and the `sync_group`
entity attribute in favor of the newer "join" framework common to all
media players.

These deprecated actions and entity attributes have now been removed.

([@rajlaud] - [#125271]) ([documentation](/integrations/squeezebox))

[@rajlaud]: https://github.com/rajlaud
[#125271]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/125271

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Templates" %}

Limit maximum template render output to 256KiB to ensure template renders do
not inject an unreasonable amount of data into the system and cause a crash.

256KiB is likely to still block Home Assistant's event loop for an unreasonable
