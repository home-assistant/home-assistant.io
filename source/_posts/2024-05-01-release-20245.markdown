## More features for our data tables

In the last release, we introduced the new data tables, and by the looks of
the responses, you all loved them! 🎉

Nevertheless, we also saw lots of feedback for additional tweaks and features,
so in this release, we’ve added a bunch!

- Grouped items can now be collapsed!
  
  <img class="no-shadow" src='https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/5662298/43fe01cf-69f1-44c0-a991-cff53106839b' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>
  
- You can now group entities by their domain in the entities panel.
- You can now filter by entity domain in the entities panel.
- Select and assign an area to multiple items at once in  the automation, scene,
  script, and device pages.
- We now store the last used grouping (and if they were collapsed or not) and
  sorting you have used, so when you return to that page, it will be the same
  as you left it.

## Created helpers from automation editor

Our good friend [@karwosts] has been busy creating a great quality of life
improvement for our automation editor this release.

I'm sure you'll know this feeling. You are creating an automation and think:
"Hey, I need a helper for this!" But then you have to leave the automation
editor, create the helper, and then go back to the automation editor.

Well, not anymore! You can now create helpers directly from the automation
editor 😎

## Lock feature for tile card

The tile card is already amazing, but [@marcgeurts] made it even better by 
adding a new feature for the tile card: Locks!

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/11457346/3dfe28bd-9396-40e9-b232-2f997f918855' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## Improved audio with ESPHome for Assist

If you're familiar with [Assist], our private voice assistant, and are using
it on an [ESPHome-based device] (like an [ESP-S3-BOX-3] or the [ATOM Echo]),
chances are you have experienced one of the biggest barriers to date when it
comes to using it on a daily basis: chopped-off audio. 😞

More often than not, the responses sent to the voice assistant device were
missing a few parts, most notably at the beginning and the end of the audio.
This was very noticeable when the responses were short, such as asking how many
lights are on in a home or the room temperature.

In conjunction with [the latest release of ESPHome] (2024.4), we are bringing
a much improved and more reliable communication between [ESPHome] and
Home Assistant for transferring voice audio, guaranteeing no audio is lost in the process.

Hear the difference in this side-by-side comparison: 

**TODO: Insert video**

In addition to updating to this release, be sure to update your ESPHome devices
to the latest version to benefit from this improvement.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- Have you ever had a misbehaving (custom) integration cause a crash? This
  release introduces new detections and [a new debug mode] to catch known/common
  unexpected integration behavior. Thanks, [@bdraco]!
- The [ESPHome integration] now supports date, time, date/time, valve, and
  event entities! The latter two require the upcoming [ESPHome] 2024.5.0
  release. Thanks [@jesserockz], [@kbx81], and [@nohat]!
- The [MQTT integration] has reached the highest quality scale: Platinum!
  Thanks [@jbouwh], for all the work you have put into this!
- The visualization graph for all Zigbee devices connected via [ZHA] has been
  improved by [@Cougar]. Devices now have colors to indicate their availability,
  signal strength, and relationship to other devices, which are much clearer.
  Nice!
- The [Glances integration] got new sensors for network traffic, disk I/O, GPU,
  and uptime. Thanks [@fhoekstra] & [@wittypluck]!
- [@Lash-L] added a service to the [Roborock integration] to easily get map
  information from your vacuum. Awesome!
- The [Airzone cloud integration] now supports water heaters. Thanks [@Noltari]!
- [@joostlek] added an extract media URL service to the [media extractor],
  allowing you to get a media item's source URL. Nice!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "AVM Fritz!SmartHome" %}

Activating the HVAC mode `heat` no longer overwrites the current target
temperature with the comfort temperature but retains the currently set target
temperature unless the thermostat is in HVAC mode `off`, in which case the
comfort temperature is still set.

Use the available presets or the set temperature service to set the target
temperature for HVAC-mode `heat`.

([@jayme-github] - [#112119]) ([documentation](/integrations/fritzbox))

[@jayme-github]: https://github.com/jayme-github
[#112119]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/112119

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Big Ass Fans" %}

The BAF fan `Auto` preset mode has been renamed to `auto`. Any scripts
or automations using this need to be updated accordingly.

([@mill1000] - [#109944]) ([documentation](/integrations/baf))

[@mill1000]: https://github.com/mill1000
[#109944]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109944

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ecobee" %}

The preset modes `Away`, `Home`, and `Sleep` have been renamed to the lower-case
variants `away`, `home`, and `sleep`.

This is consistent with the rest of Home Assistant, which also means
Home Assistant can support icons and translations for these.

If you used these preset modes in your automations or scripts, you will need
to update them to use the new names.

[@gagebenne]: https://github.com/gagebenne
[#116072]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116072

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Honeywell Total Connect Comfort (US)" %}

The auxiliary heat climate option has been deprecated and will be removed in
Home Assistant 2024.10.

Use the newly added emergency heat switch entity to set the thermostat mode
to the previous auxiliary heat mode.

([@mkmer] - [#114110]) ([documentation](/integrations/honeywell))

[@mkmer]: https://github.com/mkmer
[#114110]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/114110

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IMAP" %}

The default for new entries is that the `text` and `headers` will no longer be
included in the `imap_content` event data. Instead, if needed, you can fetch
the email content using the `imap.fetch` service.

It will not break for existing entries where we assume `text` and `headers`
are included.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Insteon" %}

The Insteon configuration panel, which was previously on the Home Assistant
sidebar, has moved to the integration page in
**Settings -> Device & services -> Insteon -> Configure**.

[@teharris1]: https://github.com/teharris1
[#105581]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/105581

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Netatmo" %}

The state of the Netatmo wind and gust direction sensor provided by
the weather station now exposes the state in lowercase.

([@joostlek] - [#115413]) ([documentation](/integrations/netatmo))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#115413]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/115413

The state of the Netatmo health index sensor provided by the weather station
now exposes the state in lowercase.

([@joostlek] - [#115409]) ([documentation](/integrations/netatmo))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#115409]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/115409

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Recorder" %}

Previously, `recorder.purge_entities` called with no arguments would purge all
entities. This PR makes this call raise an error instead. 

It was too easy for a user to accidentally purge his entire database using the
old logic. Users who want to purge all entities can still use
the `recorder.purge` service to achieve the same effect, and that service
is more obvious in how it behaves.

[@karwosts]: https://github.com/karwosts
[#110066]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/110066

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Traccar Server" %}

The following attributes have been removed from `device_tracker` entities
provided by the Traccar server integration:

- `address`
- `altitude`
- `battery_level`
- `geofence`
- `speed`

All of these are now dedicated sensor entities that you can enable.

The following attributes have been removed from `device_tracker` entities
provided by the Traccar server integration:

- `motion`
- `status`

All of these are now dedicated binary sensor entities that you can enable.
