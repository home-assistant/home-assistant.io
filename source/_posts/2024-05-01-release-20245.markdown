Home Assistant Core 2024.5! üéâ

The last two releases were massive! With our [new drag 'n drop dashboards](/blog/2024/03/06/release-20243/)
and the tools to [organize your Home Assistant instance](/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/),
it is hard to top those releases... üòÖ

So, this release is just a _tiny bit smaller_ than those two, but still epic! ü§ò

My personal favorite is the new features added to the data tables, which many
of you requested since [the last update](/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#upgraded-tables).
But the ability to change the names of the devices shown on the energy dashboard
is a close second!

Oh! We've held our [State of the Open Home 2024 live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa__fLArsFk)!
In case you've missed it, I would definitely recommend watching it back. There are tons of cool things
and spoilers in there!

But more importantly, it launched the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/),
which now governs our beloved Home Assistant project! ‚ù§Ô∏è Read more in the [State of the Open Home 2024 blog post](/blog/2024/04/24/state-of-the-open-home-2024/).

Anyway, I will not hold you any longer. Enjoy the release!

## More features for our data tables

In our last release, we [introduced new data tables](/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#upgraded-tables)
and we were thrilled to see that you all loved them! üéâ

However, we also received a lot of feedback for additional tweaks and features,
so we've added a bunch of them in this release. üòé

One of the most requested features of these new tables' new
[item grouping](/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#item-grouping)¬†was the
ability to collapse them, and we‚Äôve added that!

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-05/collapse-groups.gif" alt="Screenrecording showing items grouped in our data tables can now be collapsed."/>
    Each item group can now be collapsed and expanded.
</p>

Another one concerned the ability to select and assign an area to multiple items
at once in the automation, scene, script, and device pages. We've added that too!

Not only that, we now store the last used grouping (and if they were
collapsed or not) and sorting you have used, so when you return to that page,
it will be the same as you left it.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-05/data-tables-assign-to-area.png' alt='Screenshot showing the device page with multiple items selected. They can all be assigned to an area with a single click.'>

Last but certainly not least, we‚Äôve added the ability to group and filter
entities by their domain in the entities panel. As the domains represent the
type of entity, this means you can group and filter, for example, all your
lights, switches, sensors, etc.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-05/data-tables-group-filter-by-domain.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new group and filter by domain functionality on the entities page.'>

## Create helpers directly from the automation editor

Our good friend [@karwosts] has been busy creating a great quality-of-life
improvement for our {% term automation %} editor for this release.

I'm sure you'll know this feeling. You are creating an automation and think:
"Hey, I need a helper for this!" But then you have to leave the automation
editor, create the helper, and then go back to the automation editor.

Well, not anymore! You can now create helpers directly from the automation
editor üòé

In this example, a timer helper is created directly from the automation editor
without leaving it:

<lite-youtube videoid="GlkqCP7NavI" videotitle="Create helpers directly from the automation editor"></lite-youtube>

## Lock features for the tile card

The tile card is already amazing, but [@marcgeurts] made it even better by
adding new features to the tile card: Locks!

When you now add a lock entity to the tile card, and if your lock supports it,
you can now add two new features to the tile card:

- [**Lock commands**](/dashboards/features/#lock-commands)
  Adds buttons to your tile card to lock or unlock the lock.
- [**Lock open door**](/dashboards/features/#lock-open-door)
  Adds a button to open/unlatch the door (with confirmation).

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-05/tile-lock-features.png' alt='Screenshots showing different tile cards with the new lock features.'>

[@marcgeurts]: https://github.com/marcgeurts

## Reorder features of the tile card

Some features of the tile card, such as the presets or the HVAC modes of a
thermostat, can show many buttons. While you can limit the buttons you‚Äôd
like to see, they may not be in the desired order.

To improve this, [@karwosts] and [@piitaya] have added the ability to reorder
the features of the tile card. For your thermostat, that means you can now
reorder the HVAC modes or presets to your liking.

<p class='img'>
    <img src="/images/blog/2024-05/tile-card-reorder-features.gif" alt="Screenrecording showing how you can now reorder the HVAC modes on the thermostat shown in a tile card.."/>
    You can now reorder the features of the tile card.

## Adjust the device names on the energy dashboard

Another outstanding quality-of-life improvement from¬†[@karwosts] is the ability
to customize the display name for energy devices on the energy dashboard.

The entity's name representing the device you use on the energy dashboard
commonly contains additional or redundant information. With this new feature,
you can customize the display name to make it more meaningful.

For example, if the entity is named _‚ÄúAttic Boiler Daily Energy Usage‚Äù_
and is shown as that today, you can now change the name displayed on the energy
dashboard to just _‚ÄúBoiler‚Äù_.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2024-05/energy-device-names.png' alt='Screenshots showing you can now assign a different display name to the energy sensor of devices that show on your energy dashboard.'>

You can adjust the name of each monitored device in the energy dashboard setting
page by going to **Settings** > **Dashboards** > **Energy** > **Individual devices**.

## Improved audio with ESPHome for Assist

If you're familiar with [Assist], our private voice assistant, and are using
it on an [ESPHome-based device] (like an [ESP-S3-BOX-3] or the [ATOM Echo]),
chances are you have experienced one of the biggest barriers to date when it
comes to using it on a daily basis: chopped-off audio. üòû

More often than not, the responses sent to the voice assistant device were
missing a few parts, most notably at the beginning and the end of the audio.
This was very noticeable when the responses were short, such as asking how many
lights are on in a home or the room temperature.

In conjunction with [the latest release of ESPHome] (2024.4), we are bringing
a much improved and more reliable communication between [ESPHome] and
Home Assistant for transferring voice audio, guaranteeing no audio is lost in the process.

Hear the difference in this side-by-side comparison:

<lite-youtube videoid="6z7FIbTgLU4" videotitle="Improved audio with ESPHome for Assist"></lite-youtube>

In addition to updating to this release, be sure to update your ESPHome devices
to the latest version to benefit from this improvement.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- Have you ever had a misbehaving (custom) integration cause a crash? This
  release introduces new detections and¬†[a new debug mode] to catch known/common
  unexpected integration behavior. Thanks, [@bdraco]!
- The [ESPHome integration] now supports date, time, date/time, valve, and
  event entities! The latter two require the upcoming [ESPHome] 2024.5.0
  release. Thanks [@jesserockz], [@kbx81], and [@nohat]!
- The [MQTT integration] has reached the highest quality scale: Platinum!
  Thanks [@jbouwh], for all the work you have put into this!
- The visualization graph for all Zigbee devices connected via [ZHA] has been
  improved by [@Cougar]. Devices now have colors to indicate their availability,
  signal strength, and relationship to other devices, which are much clearer.
  Nice!
- The [Glances integration] got new sensors for network traffic, disk I/O, GPU,
  and uptime. Thanks [@fhoekstra] & [@wittypluck]!
- [@Lash-L] added a service to the [Roborock integration] to easily get map
  information from your vacuum. Awesome!
- The [Airzone cloud integration] now supports water heaters. Thanks [@Noltari]!
- [@joostlek] added an extract media URL service to the [media extractor],
  allowing you to get a media item's source URL. Nice!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "AVM Fritz!SmartHome" %}

Activating the HVAC mode `heat` no longer overwrites the current target
temperature with the comfort temperature but retains the currently set target
temperature unless the thermostat is in HVAC mode `off`, in which case the
comfort temperature is still set.

Use the available presets or the set temperature service to set the target
temperature for HVAC-mode¬†`heat`.

[#112119]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/112119

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Big Ass Fans" %}

The BAF fan `Auto` preset mode has been renamed to `auto`. Any scripts
or automations using this need to be updated accordingly.

([@mill1000] - [#109944]) ([documentation](/integrations/baf))

[@mill1000]: https://github.com/mill1000
[#109944]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/109944

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ecobee" %}

The preset modes `Away`, `Home`, and `Sleep` have been renamed to the lower-case
variants `away`, `home`, and `sleep`.

This is consistent with the rest of Home Assistant, which also means
Home Assistant can support icons and translations for these.

If you used these preset modes in your automations or scripts, you will need
to update them to use the new names.

[#116072]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/116072

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Honeywell Total Connect Comfort (US)" %}

The auxiliary heat climate option has been deprecated and will be removed in
Home Assistant 2024.10.

Use the newly added emergency heat switch entity to set the thermostat mode
to the previous auxiliary heat mode.

([@mkmer] - [#114110]) ([documentation](/integrations/honeywell))

[#114110]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/114110

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IMAP" %}

The default for new entries is that the `text` and `headers` will no longer be
included in the `imap_content` event data. Instead, if needed, you can fetch
the email content using the `imap.fetch` service.

It will not break for existing entries where we assume `text` and `headers`
are included.

{% details "Insteon" %}

The Insteon configuration panel, which was previously on the Home Assistant
sidebar, has moved to the integration page in
**Settings -> Device & services -> Insteon -> Configure**.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LG Netcast" %}

Turn on action for turning the TV on via a custom script
within `configuration.yaml` has been changed to use a custom automation trigger
`lg_netcast.turn_on` or a device trigger that can be set up from the UI.

{% details "Netatmo" %}

The state of the Netatmo wind and gust direction sensor provided by
the weather station now exposes the state in lowercase.

The state of the Netatmo health index sensor provided by the weather station
now exposes the state in lowercase.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Recorder" %}

Previously, `recorder.purge_entities` called with no arguments would purge all
entities. This PR makes this call raise an error instead.

It was too easy for users to accidentally purge their entire database using the
old logic. Users who want to purge all entities can still use
the `recorder.purge` service to achieve the same effect, and that service
is more obvious in how it behaves.

{% details "Traccar Server" %}

The following attributes have been removed from `device_tracker` entities
provided by the Traccar server integration:

- `address`
- `altitude`
- `battery_level`
- `geofence`
- `speed`

All of these are now dedicated sensor entities that you can enable.
