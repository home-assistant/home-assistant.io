It's finally here, one of the most common feature requests for the Home Assistant
Android Companion app: you can now configure multiple Home Assistant servers. The
app can send sensor updates to all servers and easily mix and match widgets, tiles,
and controls for different servers ðŸŽ‰

Plus, a preview of the Home Assistant app is now available via the Amazon Appstore
on Windows 11, which allows you to quickly connect your computer to Home Assistant.

There are also other changes that add some polish to the app and improve support
for features in the latest Home Assistant releases, so let's dig into the update!

## Configure multiple Home Assistant servers

Sometimes, one Home Assistant instance is not enough. You like Home Assistant so
much that you decide to help someone else get started, there's a second home in
your life, or you regularly visit someplace else where they're using Home Assistant.

Before this update, if you wanted to access more than one server it was a bit of a
hassle. Switching apps, creating bookmarks, and using different profiles. Let alone
connecting your Android device to multiple servers for features like sensors
and notifications.

This issue now belongs to the past, as there's a new option in **{% my config title="Settings" %}** >
**Companion app** to configure a second server, and another one after that, and another...
They will all show up in the app, and you can use all features you've come to
expect, like lots of sensors for your device and support for push notifications.
Each one gets individual settings, so if you don't want to share your step count
and enable location tracking everywhere, that's OK.

That's not all - you can also use all servers _outside_ the app, mixing and
matching servers when using shortcuts, notifications, widgets, tiles and controls.
Toggling lights from three different homes side-by-side? No problem!

Note: the Wear OS app does not yet support multiple servers.

## Now available on Windows 11 (preview)

The Home Assistant Android Companion app is now available [via the Amazon Appstore]
on [supported Windows 11 devices]. While there are already great options to integrate your
computer from the community out there, the Companion app makes it easy to start
and benefits from all the work on the Android app, frequently adding new features.

Windows does not always provide correct information to the app and may shut down
background work, including sensors, after several minutes, which is why we are
releasing Windows 11 support for the app as a preview. Android support in Windows
11 continues to get better and we intend to make adjustments to improve the
experience in the future.

## Refining Wear OS

The Home Assistant app has been available for over a year now on Wear OS watches
and continues to improve. Earlier this year, initial support for Assist was added,
and in this update [@dshokouhi] made it easier to access using a watchface
complication. Now Assist is only a tap away!

Got a lot of entities and want to hide the clutter on your watch? You could already
add favorites which would be displayed at the top of the app, but it would still load
all entities below them. Now, there is an option to only show favorites to reduce
what gets loaded and prevent accidental changes. Try it out and let us know if you
prefer this more focused experience!

[@SkechyWolf] and [@dshokouhi] also worked on the look and feel of the app to make it
fit in better with other modern Wear apps.

## Other noteworthy changes

There's more in this update, here are some highlights:

- Any sensor with a location attached will now show up for navigation when using Android
  Auto. Nice one, [@dshokouhi]!
- [@jpelgrom] added initial support for the new Thread integration in 2023.3. Thank you!
- [@Adi146] and [@dshokouhi] worked to make the Beacon Monitor more reliable when in the
  background and when toggling it on and off, nice to see improvements!
- Put a lot of work in a custom dashboard, only to have it break on your phone because of
  text that is ever so slightly too small or unwanted auto-rotation? No more, as [@dmiales]
  tweaked settings to prevent this from happening!
- Got a notification that should only show up on your watch? In the previous update, support
  was added for notifications to the Wear OS app, and in this update work continues by
  [@dshokouhi], with the app now supporting TTS notifications.

Even more people worked on fixing bugs in this update, like [@Suxsem] and [@JBassett]. Thanks
to all of those who contributed. If you have a good idea to improve the app or found a bug to
