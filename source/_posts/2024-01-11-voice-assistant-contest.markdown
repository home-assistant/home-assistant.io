We are organizing a voice assistant contest for the community, starting on the 17th of January and ending on the 10th of March, and there will be prizes! You can win Home Assistant Greens and Home Assistant SkyConnects and have a chance to be on a live stream with us to talk about your winning entry.

Tune in to our live stream on Wednesday, 17th of January, at 12:00 PST / 21:00 CET to learn all about the contest, the categories, and the prizes you can win! Michael Hansen *(Voice Lead at Nabu Casa and Founder of Rhasspy)* and JLo *(Product Manager of Home Assistant)* will first quickly recap the components we created to make voice assistants during Year of the Voice. Then, we will create several voice assistants live during the stream to show you how you can get started!

This live stream will be the perfect opportunity for everyone who loves our voice assistants but still needs to figure out where to start. You can learn everything you need during the stream and be fully prepared to build the voice assistant of your dreams. We're excited to see what you will create and enter into the contest!
