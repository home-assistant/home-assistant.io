things popped up around our community, which we thought was worth sharing.

## Blueprint of the week
------

I think this situation is familiar to many parents: your children who get
out of bed too early and who you would like to learn when it is the right
time to get out of bed.

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sleep-trainer-for-children-using-input-datetime-and-an-rgb-light/292003" %}

This week's blueprint is that of [koosvanw](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/koosvanw),
who created a blueprint for the above situation that works with a light that
can change color and where the brightness can also be adjusted. Try it out!

## Threedy card
------

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/dangreco/threedy" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-06-04-community-highlights/threedy.png'
            alt="Preview of the threedy card"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:70%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Do you have a 3D printer and are you not quite sure how to display it in a
beautiful way in your Lovelace dashboard? Then try this card from
[dangreco](https://github.com/dangreco), which works well in combination
with [octoprint](/integrations/octoprint).

## ESPHome weather station
------

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/hugokernel/esphome-weather-station" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-06-04-community-highlights/weather.jpg'
            alt="Preview of the ESPHome weather station"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Have you always wanted to build a weather station in your garden? Then
try the ESPHome variant of [hugokernel](https://github.com/hugokernel),
it is quite extensive with many measuring options.

## Garage fingerprint
------

This week we also came across something cool that was shared on our [subreddit][reddit]
page. For example, you could open a garage door by means of geofencing from your
phone or with an NFC tag. But [Nhminer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nhminer/) has
tried another option, namely opening with a fingerprint sensor ðŸ˜²

Do you want to know more about it? Then also check
