## Improved drag & drop support for automations

As of this release, dragging and dropping triggers, conditions and actions in
the automation editor is always possible. Previously, you had to enable
re-ordering explicitly in the automation editor settings, now it is always
possible.

But what is even more exciting, is that you can now drag and drop elements
into other nested elements. For example, you can now drag a condition into
the condition of an if-then or choose action.

</video>

## Download statistics from the history dashboard

You can now download the statistics you are viewing, from the history dashboard
as a CSV file. This allows you to do further analysis on the data, in for
example Excel, or to visualize it in other ways. Thanks, [@balloob]!

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/1444314/08a785c1-e32b-4caf-96c2-70d4cbcd46e0' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## Shipping on a new Python version

This release ships running on Python 3.12! In case you are wondering, what is
that? Well, Python is the programming language Home Assistant is written in.

Why it matters? It provides many improvements to the foundation we are building
Home Assistant on, most noteably: It is faster! 🚀

Don't worry! If you run the Home Assistant Operating System or are using the
Home Assistant Container installation type: You won’t have to do anything, as we
handle the upgrade to Python 3.12 for you. Just upgrade Home Assistant as
you normally would and you are good to go! 😎

## Update entities for ZHA devices

[ZHA](/integrations/zha) (Zigbee Home Automation, our built-in Zigbee integration)
now provides update entities to Home Assistant!

This means you can get notified when a device has a firmware update available,
and you can trigger the update from Home Assistant!

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://github.com/home-assistant/core/assets/1335687/17420fd3-a054-4683-a950-a47b06b5faf6' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## Matter diagnostics and actions

Home Assistant works actively on providing the best support for [Matter](/integrations/matter)
devices out of the box. To help with that, we have added more information and
controls for your Matter devices in the UI.

On the device page of the Matter device in Home Assistant, we will now show
additional diagnostic information about the device. This information can be
used to troubleshoot issues with the device or when reporting issues. Some
examples include: The type of network the device is using, its addresses and IDs,
device types and its connected [fabrics](/integrations/matter#multi-fabric-join-to-multiple-controllers).

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505841299220594748/1202269675736539196/CleanShot_2024-01-31_at_16.10.09.png?ex=65ccd7e3&is=65ba62e3&hm=39f8817abfbae8d3a866dbd3e201a27e445dd3d7cfd60683524bedd03e0985b2&' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

Besides more information, there are also new actions you can take on the device.
For example, ping the device, start comissioning or removing a fabric, or force
a full device interview to sync all its information.

## All known assist devices

We've added a small additional page, to give you insight into the Assist devices
you have active in your Home. You can find this on the
{% my voice_assistants title="Assist configuration dashboard" %} by selecting
the new "assist devices" button.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/assets/1444314/1e18d5c0-b5d3-438e-8d98-edbc312dbb01' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## Icons everywhere

This release, we completely changed how Home Assistant handles icons. An big
effort from many people, with almost... no change! That is right, _almost_
everthing looks just the same as before.

We did make some improvements! For example, integrations can now
provide icons for things like fan speeds, or thermostat presets, but also
actions can now have their own icons to match their specific goal:

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/674164904298676225/1202026201879953408/CleanShot_2024-01-31_at_00.02.502x.png?ex=65cbf523&is=65b98023&hm=8ba42ce1c98c9d92c8033e100913ee843bbb8df7a8d37e97e7c73d4d863dbc98&' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

Areas now have icons! You can set them in the area configuration. They show
up in the area target pickers/selectors and in the area dashboard itself
(in case you didn't upload a picture).

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505841299220594748/1202269492701573200/CleanShot_2024-01-31_at_16.09.20.png?ex=65ccd7b8&is=65ba62b8&hm=40f92cd7b6ca3bbe4077d65eacd0b34b1ca1bc4a7545a6df9dcbd091bdf3dc55&' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## Integration authentication issues are now shown in the repairs dashboards

When one of your integrations is having authentication issues, Home Assistant
will now report this in the {% my repairs title="repairs dashboard" %}.

Previously this was only visible on the integration dashboard, but now it shows
up in the repairs dashboard as this is the place where Home Assistant reports
all issues with your system.

<video width="600" controls>
  <source src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505841299220594748/1202269900790571018/CleanShot_2024-01-31_at_14.09.45.mp4?ex=65ccd819&is=65ba6319&hm=275b23b1ba35018d1db79ba9fa4c32fe8093d219ed65ac110dedcbac2efa2738&" type="video/mp4">
</video>

_(This temporary video is not the best example, as it doesn't really ask for
new authentication details. We will update this video before the release.)_

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- [@edenhaus] improved how we handle errors in our form fields. We no longer
  show the technical coding gibberish that often showed up in the past. Nice!
- When you [change the type of a switch entity] to, for example, a garage door 
  entity, you will now have to option to invert its behavior.
  Thanks, [@emontnemery]!
- The [Ecovacs] integration received lots of love from [@edenhaus], and now
  has support for many Deebot vacuum models with tons of entities to automate
  with. Nice job!
- [@mib1185] added automatic cleanups of old/unused refresh tokens 🧹. This
  means you will be logged out on a device that hasn't used Home Assistant for
  90 days. Clean and tidy!
- The [Tuya] integration can now be set up using the the Tuya Smart or Smart
  Life app directly. No more need for developer accounts or complicated
  procedures!
- Are you an Jinja templating Ninja? [@TNTLarsn] added a new `bitwise_xor`
  filter for you to use. Awesome!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Authentication" %}

We changes the way refresh tokens are handled. Refresh tokens are part of what
keeps you logged in to Home Assistant.

Refresh tokens will be automatically deleted when unused. A refresh token
is considered unused if it has not been used for a login within 90 days.

This means that if your logged in session hasn't been used for 90 days, you
will be logged out. You will need to log in again.

If you need a permanent token, then we recommend using [Long-lived access tokens](/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token).

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Blink" %}

The options flow that gave to option to set a custom scan interval, has been
removed.

Adjustable scan interval is no longer allowed, but above all, the option has
had no effect on the integration since 2023.11.

You can use an automation as an alternative to create a custom polling rate
([documentation](/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval)).
Updating one entity in a blink configuration will update all entities in each
blink configuration.

The services `ezviz.ptz`, `ezviz.sound_alarm`, and `alarm_sound` have been moved
to button and select entities in release 2023.8. Support for the deprecated
services has now been completely removed.

If you are using these services in automations or script, you will need to
update them to match this change.

{% details "JustNimbus" %}

The following sensors have been removed from the JustNimbus integration,
since they're no longer available through JustNimbus' API:

- Pump starts
- Pump hours
- Error code
- Total replenished
- Pump flow
- Drink flow

The following sensors have been renamed:

- Total saved (`total_saved`) -> Total saved (`water_saved`)
- Total use (`totver`) -> Total use (`water_used`)
- Maximum reservoir content (`reservoir_content_max`) -> Reservoir capacity (`reservoir_capacity`)

Automations or scripts using any of the removed or renamed entities should be
updated. Once updated the old entities can be safely removed.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Lutron" %}

The Lutron integration previously created fans as light entities. This has been
changed to create actual fan entities instead.

If you have automations, scripts, scenes or dashboards that used these light
entities, you will need to update them to use the new fan entities.

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT `sensor` or `binary_sensor` configuration that have an `entity_category`
explicitly set to `config` will fail to set up. Maintainers should set the
`entity_category` attribute to `diagnostic` or omit the config attribute.

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#107199]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/107199

---

When an MQTT entity has a device name that is equal to the entity name, or
starts with the device name, this will no longer be corrected.

When entities like these are created they will have both device and entity name
in the friendly name. If the device name is to be omitted because it is the same
as the entity name, then the entity `name` attribute sould be set to `null` in
the JSON payload or YAML configuration.

The support for MQTT vacuum entities with a `legacy` schema is removed after 6
months of deprecation. Users can use the `state` schema instead,
which is now the default.

The start time of day and start time of night sensors have been replaced by
time entities. If you used these sensors in automations or scripts, you will
need to update your automations to use the new time entities.

{% details "RESTful Command" %}

Call to RESTful command services will no longer silently fail and will raise an
exception on, for example, timeout or decoding errors.

You could consider using [`continue_on_error`](/docs/scripts/#continuing-on-error)
for scripts and automations that use RESTful commands that are allowed to fail
occasionally.

{% details "Roborock" %}

The services `vacuum.start_pause` was deprecated in 2023.8. Support for the
deprecated services has now been completely removed.

If you are still using them, please adjust your automations and scripts,
use `vacuum.pause` or `vacuum.start` instead.

{% details "Swiss public transport" %}

The state value of the sensor is now a standardize timestamp.
Further, all `timestamps` and `durations` in the additional fields are now also
proper datetime/durations.

{% details "TP-Link Smart Home" %}

To prevent overloading the power strips, the energy data is now polled every
60 seconds. If you need to poll the data faster, please use an automation that
calls the `homeassistant.update_entity` service.

{% details "Tuya" %}

Tuya has provided an easier and improved login method for Home Assistant users.

Having a developer account with Tuya is no longer required; instead, you can
scan a QR code with your Tuya Smart of Smart Life app to authenticate it
with Home Assistant.

After updating to this release, Home Assistant will ask you to re-authenticate
your Tuya Smart or Smart Life account using this new method.

The services `vacuum.turn_on` and `vacuum.turn_off` were deprecated in 2023.8.
Support for the deprecated services has now been completely removed.

If you are still using them, please adjust your automations and scripts and
use `vacuum.start` and `vacuum.stop` instead.

Previously, Tuya would fall back to using the metric system if the temperature
unit was not reported by a climate device. This behavior has been changed to
use the default unit configured on your system instead.

{% details "Webooks" %}

Since version 2023.7 you have been informed that the "local only" option of
webhooks would become the default. With this release this change was now put
into affect. Please, if needed, adjust your automation triggers.

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

The default rounding of numeric sensors to two decimals, has been removed.

We now let the device and driver decide what precision should be reported. This
allows devices with greater precision to report accurately.

You can change the display precision in the UI for the sensor or use a template
sensor if you want to change the precision.

Set suggested precision to 0 decimals for voltage sensors with native unit in V.
This will uniform the display precision of voltage sensors where there otherwise
seems to be a variety of precision reported from different devices.

If you want to change the precision you can do that in the sensor options in the
UI or with a template sensor.

The Fan and Dry climate Preset modes have been removed after a period of
deprecation. You should update your automations or scripts to use the
corresponding Dry and Fan **HVAC modes** instead, if you haven't done so
already.

## Farewell to the following

The following integrations are also no longer available as of this release:

- **Facebox** has been removed. It is no longer possible to get API keys and
  thus no longer possible to use this integration.  
  ([@reedy] - [#107005])
- **Legrand Home+ Control** has been removed as their API shut down in December.
  Use [the Netatmo integration](/integrations/netatmo/) as an alternative to
  integrate your Legrand Home+ Control devices.  
  ([@jpbede] - [#107587])
- **Life360** has been removed. They are now actively blocking third-party
  access, including Home Assistant. The [Home Assistant Companion app](https://companion.home-assistant.io/)
  is a good, and (above all) privacy-friendly alternative.
