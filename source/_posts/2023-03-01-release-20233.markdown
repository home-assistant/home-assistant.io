Home Assistant Core 2023.3! üéâ

February was a short month, resulting in a short release cycle, but... That
didn't stop anybody from stuffing this release with many great improvements!

As the release title most fittingly puts it, most features of this release
show up in dialogs. New dialogs, restyled dialogs, new features that appear
in dialogs, and all sorts of new dialogues you can have with Assist. Something
with "dialogs" all over these release notes!

Besides dialogs, this release brings in three new integrations, updates to
Thread and Matter, and quite an impressive list of other noteworthy changes.

My personal favorite in this release is, undoubtedly, the all-new restart dialog.
It brings in proper choice, less navigation, and it looks slick! I am genuinely
really loving and enjoying the result. ü§©

Enjoy the release!

## Restarting Home Assistant

Since we started redesigning our menu structure (a little over a year
ago), "Restarting" Home Assistant has been a source of discussion in our
community. Home Assistant can be restarted, reloaded, rebooted,
and powered off; it quickly became unclear what to use and when.

We've come up with a solution inspired by the good old Windows XP computer
turn-off screen. [@matthiasdebaat] made a UX that has been implemented
by [@piitaya] that will hopefully make this all better, more clear.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/restart-home-assistant.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new restart dialog of Home Assistant that provides a guidance on what action to take.'>

Nice, right? ü§© What is entirely new is the first item shown: "Quick reload".
Quick reload calls all active integrations in your system that support
reloading YAML configuration on the fly üöÄ.

This means all integrations individually listed as reloadable under the YAML
tab in the developer tools are reloaded simultaneously! Also, [@frenck] made
quick reload available as a {% my developer_call_service service="homeassistant.reload_all" title="service" %},
so you can automate with it.

Lastly, another place for finding it more easily; the option to restart has
also been added to the three-dotted overflow menu in the top right of the
settings screen.

## Asking Assist for the current state of things

This release updates Assist with the capability to ask for the state of things
around your home. For example:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/ask-assist-for-states.png' alt='Screenshot showing the assist conversation dialog demonstrating new intents to get the state of things in your home.'>

Intents for three types of questions have been added:

- Ask for the state of a single entity:
  - _"What is the outside temperature?"_
  - _"Is the front door locked?"_
  - _"What is the power consumption in the office?"_
- Any or all questions:
  - _"Are any lights on in the bedroom?"_
  - _"Are all windows closed in the kitchen?"_
- How many or which questions:
  - _"How many lights are on in the office?"_
  - _"Which doors are open?"_

Thanks, [@synesthesiam] for implementing this, and thanks to language leaders
and contributors for helping out providing translations for all these [intents]! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Want to help with adding support for these intents in your language? Please do!

## Cleaner entity information dialogs

The entity information dialog (also known as the more-info dialog) got some
nice improvements in this release.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/new-entity-dialog.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new entity information dialogs, highlighting the top bar changes.'>

The "Info", "History", "Settings", and "Related" tabs have been removed, which
gives the dialog a much cleaner look. Icons for settings and history have been
added in the top right to replace these tabs. The new three-dotted overflow menu
can bring up related entity information and provides a direct link to the device
dashboard of the device that provided this entity.

Nice job [@matthiasdebaat] and [@piitaya]!

## New dialogs for lights, switches and siren entities

There is more to tell about this release's more-info dialogs. [@matthiasdebaat]
and [@piitaya] have been working on the designs shared
[during the State of the Open Home 2022](https://www.youtube.com/live/D936T1Ze8-4?feature=share&t=5193).
This release brings in the first overhauls to the entity dialogs of light,
switch, and siren entities.

<img class="no-shadow" style="padding-right: 24px" src='/images/blog/2023-03/new-light-switch-more-info-dialog.png' alt='Screenshots showing the new entity more-info dialogs for a light, a switch and a switch with an assumed state.'>

The new dialogs are nice and clean. The new sliders and buttons work absolutely
magnificent on both desk and mobile. For the brightness slider, you can drag
it all down without turning the light off, making it possible to dim your
light to even the lowest point.

In case of a light, additional controls for turning on/off, color (temperature),
and effects appear right below the slider. In the top right, you'll find the new
controls that come with the cleaner look we discussed in the previous paragraph.

## Sensor display precision

Got a sensor that has too many decimals in its numeric value? Would you like
to display it rounded to a single or maybe even no decimals?

Just ~~create a template sensor~~ change it directly from the UI!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/entity-precision.png' alt='Screenshot showing you can now set the numerical
precision of a sensor entity value shown in the UI from the entity settings dialog.'>

Thanks [@emontnemery] for building out this feature!

This has also been extended into integrations, which now can provide
a more precise value while suggesting to, show it with less precision
by default. This allows you to change it if you don't like the defaults.

You can also take advantage of the configured precision when writing templates,
as the `states()` function has been extended to help with that.
You can find more information on
[formatting sensor states in the templating documentation](/docs/configuration/templating/#formatting-sensor-states).

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery

## New create automation dialog

Let's continue the dialogs theme this release! As [@piitaya] also gave
the dialog you see when you create a new automation, a facelift!

You can now quickly find and pick a Blueprint to use for your automation or
create one from scratch. The overall look and feel is much more modern, and
fits our current design better.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/new-automation-dialog.png' alt='Screenshot showing the improved createnew automation dialogs, which allows easily starting a new automation from a blueprint or from scratch.'>

You may notice it now shows author information in this dialog. If you create
Blueprints, you can now add [author information] to your Blueprint,
which will be shown in this dialog.

## Thread & Matter

Behind the scenes, a lot is happening; adding, extending and improving
Thread & Matter support for Home Assistant.

A couple of weeks ago, we published [an extensive blog article on where we're at](/blog/2023/02/08/state-of-matter-and-thread/).
Some of the features mentioned in that blog post will become available today.

The most visual change is that the [Thread integration](/integrations/thread)
will now show up on your devices & services dashboard. The "Configure" button
on the Thread card will reveal the all-new Thread panel.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-03/thread-panel.png' alt='Screenshot of the all new Thread panel, giving insight into your Thread network(s).'>

The Thread panel lets you view your Thread network(s) and provides controls
to add an OpenThread border router. More importantly, an option to download
diagnostics has been added in the three-dotted menu in the top right. This will
help with finding, triaging, and fixing issues as the development
on Thread continues.

As for Matter, it now supports connecting to Matter bridges! So, you can
now connect, for example, your Hue hub over Matter!

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-03/matter-bridges.png' alt='Screenshot showing the Home Assistant Matter integration card, with lots of devices and entities; brought in by Hue bridges.'></a>
Two Philips Hue bridges connected using Matter, and it is fast!
</p>

Although, if you want to connect your Hue hub, we of course recommend using
the dedicated [Hue integration](/integrations/hue), which will provide a much
more stable and feature rich solution. Nevertheless, having bridge support is
a huge milestone!

Adding a Matter device is now also more logical. Just add a new device
from the Devices & Services page, just like how you would add any other device
or integration to Home Assistant. Oh! Let's not forget about [@ArturoGuerra],
who added support for color lights to Matter! Thanks!

## Python 3.11 support

Support for Python 3.11 is here! üêç

This change is only interesting if you manually run Home Assistant
directly in Python (the Home Assistant Core installation method). If that
is the case, you can now start using Home Assistant with Python 3.11, which
should dramatically improve performance over previous Python versions.

We are also working on upgrading to Python 3.11 for our Home Assistant OS,
Supervised, and Container installation methods so we can provide
the same performance improvements. We'll keep you posted.

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- You can now change the unit of measurement for a sensor that provides power readings.
  So, if you like your kW sensor to be displayed as W, that is now possible. Thanks, [@emontnemery]!
- All [contributed translations] are now automatically updated with each release!
  This includes patch releases. Thanks, [@frenck].
- Faster it is! [@bdraco] keeps improving the performance, and this release is no exception!
  The statistics should be almost instant now, which is notable on
  the energy dashboard. Lots of MQTT-related performance improvements too!
- The statistic graph card can now hide the legend, nice and clean [@piitaya]!
- You can now use templates in the `for` parameter of [state conditions]. Thanks, [@emontnemery]!
- Our (opt-in only) {% my analytics %} will now include the database engine and version
  you use with your recorder. This helps us making database-related decisions and improvements.
  Thanks, [@ludeeus]!
- [@marcelveldt] added support for Smart Scenes (Natural Light) to the [Philips Hue] integrations. Nice!
- If your [ONVIF] camera supports it, it will now provide switch entities
  for auto-focus, wiper, and IR lights. Thanks, [@partofthething]!
- The input select helper first, last, previous, and next services are now also
  available on select entities, thanks [@frenck].
- It looks like [@jesserockz] took a small break from [ESPHome] to implement support
  for the SwitchBot Blind Tilt to the [SwitchBot] integration. Thank you!
- The [OpenAI Conversation] integration now has options to customize it to your liking, thanks [@bendews]!
- [@marcolivierarsenault] added support for [ecobee] ventilator, awesome!
- The [Reolink] integration now provides entities to update the firmware of your camera, control zoom,
  and control auto-focus. Thanks [@starkillerOG]!
- [KNX] Data Secure support is added, and importing your Keyfile to use it is now super easy. Just upload it from your browser
  when configuring it in Home Assistant. Awesome [@farmio]!
- [@thecode] added support for [Shelly] Pro 3EM energy sensors, nice!
- [ScreenLogic] now supports local push updates for almost all entities. Thanks [@dieselrabbit]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Assist / Conversation" %}

Previously, all entities and areas were exposed to Assist's default agent. This
is now restricted to entities of the following domains:

- `climate`
- `cover`
- `fan`
- `humidifier`
- `light`
- `lock`
- `scene`
- `script`
- `sensor`
- `switch`
- `vacuum`
- `water_heater`

Only areas with exposed entities will be exposed themselves. In the future,
this will be customizable through the frontend.

[#88274]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/88274

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Atmospheric pressure device triggers" %}

A bug with the atmospheric pressure sensor device triggers has been corrected.
Automations using such device triggers will need to be adjusted/reconfigured.

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#87377]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/88320

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ecobee" %}

The aux heat toggle will now show as enabled when the device is in
"aux heat only" mode instead of only when it is running.

([@Lash-L] - [#86100]) ([documentation](/integrations/ecobee))

[@Lash-L]: https://github.com/Lash-L
[#86100]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86100

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Fibaro" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Fibaro integration
has been removed.

Fibaro is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML configuration has
been imported in previous releases and can now be safely removed from
your YAML configuration files.

([@rappenze] - [#87939]) ([documentation](/integrations/fibaro))

[@rappenze]: https://github.com/rappenze
[#87939]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87939

{% enddetails %}

{% details "GoodWe Inverter" %}

Inverter "Operation Mode" select values were changed to snake_case and localized.

- "General mode" -> `general`
- "Off grid mode" -> `off_grid`
- "Backup mode" -> `backup`
- "Eco mode" -> `eco`
- "Peak shaving" -> `peak_shaving`
- "Eco charge mode" -> `eco_charge`
- "Eco discharge mode" -> `eco_discharge`

If you used these select values in your automations or scripts, you will need
to adjust those to match this change.

[#86901]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86901

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

VOC mappings in the HomeKit integration have been improved to use the IAQ
guidelines for Europe released by the WHO (World Health Organization).

HomeKit | Previous VOC ¬µg/m3 | New VOC ¬µg/m3
-- | -- | --
Excellent | <= 24 | <= 250
Good | <= 48 | <= 500
Fair | <= 64 | <= 1000
Inferior | <= 96 | <= 3000
Poor | > 96 | > 3000

{% details "Matter" %}

With this release, you will need to update your Matter Server instance.
You must use `python-matter-server` 3.0.0 or greater (schema 2).

- If you use the `Matter Server` add-on, you need to have at least version `4.0.0`.
- If you run your own Docker container, or some other installation method,
  you will need to update your `python-matter-server` instance to at least `3.0.0`.

[#88607]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/88607

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

The behavior for receiving values on sensors that expect numeric* values
has changed.

- A `'None'` value or a value rendered to `'None'` will
  set such a sensor to an `unknown` state.
- Empty values on such sensors (`''`) are ignored and will not affect the state
  of the sensor.

Integrations need to be corrected to send the correct values if an update is
published and no valid update value is available for the sensor.

- Other sensors that do not expect a numeric value will still accept
  an empty string as a value.

\* Sensors expect numeric values if at least one of the following applies:
- A `device_class` is set but is not a `date`, `timestamp`, `enum`, or any custom device class.
- A `state_class` is set.
- A `unit_of_measurement` is set.
- A `suggested_display_precision` is set.

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#87004]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87004

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Plugwise" %}

The unit of measurement for the P1 gas consumed interval sensor is changed
from `m¬≥` to `m¬≥/h`. Go to Developer Option --> Statistics for the options
on how to handle this change in your existing installation.

([@bouwew] - [#87449]) ([documentation](/integrations/plugwise))

[@bouwew]: https://github.com/bouwew
[#87449]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87449

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Profiler" %}

The `profiler.memory` service is unavailable when using Python 3.11, due to
an incompatibility with a needed dependency for this service. It will return
when the used `guppy3` package becomes available with Python 3.11 compatibility.

([@bdraco] - [#88136]) ([documentation](/integrations/profiler))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#88136]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/88136

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Template: Covers" %}

Template covers using `optimistic: false` without `value_template` nor
`position_template` still updated state optimistically. The integration now respects the optimistic setting of false. If you want to keep the
previous behavior, you must set the `optimistic` value to `true`,
or remove the optimistic declaration.

([@ylemoigne] - [#87925]) ([documentation](/integrations/template))

[@ylemoigne]: https://github.com/ylemoigne
[#87925]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87925

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Trafikverket Weather" %}

The unit of measurement was incorrectly set to `mm` while the
API is returning `mm/h`. The unit of measurement and device class have now been corrected.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#87308]) ([documentation](/integrations/trafikverket_weatherstation))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#87308]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87308

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Todoist" %}

Labels used by custom projects for filtering are now case-sensitive.

Previously the labels were automatically lower-cased by the integration,
but in Todoist a label like `Test` and `test` are considered unique.
Because of that labels will now be case sensitive in your configuration.

([@boralyl] - [#87904]) ([documentation](/integrations/todoist))

[@boralyl]: https://github.com/boralyl
[#87904]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87904

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The `event_id` and `event_score` state attributes are now excluded from being
recorded in the database. They remain available for use in automations
and scripts.

([@bdraco] - [#88387]) ([documentation](/integrations/unifiprotect))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#88387]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/88387

---

The previously deprecated "Detected Object" sensor has been removed.

The sensor was removed because if multiple objects are detected at once
(very common for package detection), Home Assistant could not be automated
using the second detected object. The sensor has been split out from the single
Detected Object sensor into multiple binary issues for each detection type.

([@bdraco] - [#85656]) ([documentation](/integrations/unifiprotect))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#85656]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85656

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Wiffi" %}

The Wiffi unit of illuminance `lux` has been adjusted to the standard unit
Home Assistant uses `lx`.

([@mampfes] - [#87377]) ([documentation](/integrations/wiffi))

[@mampfes]: https://github.com/mampfes
[#87377]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87377

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

With this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance.
You must use `zwave-js-server` 1.26.0 or greater (schema 26).

- If you use the `Z-Wave JS` add-on, you need at least version `0.1.76`.
- If you use the `Z-Wave JS UI` add-on, you need at least version `1.6.3`.
- If you use the `Z-Wave JS UI` Docker container, you need at least version `8.8.6`.
- If you run your own Docker container or some other installation method,
  you will need to update your `zwave-js-server` instance to at least `1.26.0`.
