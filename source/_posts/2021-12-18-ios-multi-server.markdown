Today we're releasing Home Assistant companion app for iOS 2021.12. The big new feature: multiple server support. Find it in the app settings on iOS and Mac. Pro-tip: Swipe with three fingers left, right, or up to quickly switch between servers. [Full release notes.](https://github.com/home-assistant/iOS/releases/tag/release%2F2021.12%2F2021.322)
