## Login page has been re-designed

The login page of Home Assistant has been re-designed to be more modern and
match [recent redesign of the Home Assistant onboarding](/blog/2023/09/06/release-20239/#onboarding).

When Home Assistant detects you are on your local home network, you will be
greeted by this lovely new login page.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/285754001-5c918c38-8570-4a4c-a478-12cbfbd6dedc.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

Just click on your user profile, and it will request your password, just like
before. Of course, when logging in from outside of your home network,
we can't do this as that would give away some of your privacy.

When you are outside of your home network, the login page will look like this:

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5662298/285753904-4a4aca42-104f-4ebd-8170-034dd2a8cfc8.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## New thermostat card

[Home Assistant 2023.9 introduced](/blog/2023/09/06/release-20239/#new-climate-humidifier-and-water-heater-entity-dialogs)
a beautiful new entity dialog for thermostat entities. Many have been asking
for a similar design for the thermostat card as well. Well, here it is!

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/284530915-91331dd1-1bff-4dcf-8d68-6aefa5608d2a.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

Maybe you have noticed, but in the screenshot above, features of the tile card
are visible! The buttons for HVAC mode and the presets are now also available
for the thermostat card. You can configure the card to show them or not, by
default, they are hidden.

Oh, the same design has been applied to the humifier and water heater cards
of course 😎.

## History dashboard showing long-term statistics

The history dashboard has gotten some love from [@karwosts] this release, he
added a big improvement to all the graph shown there.

Previously, the graphs would only show the state history, which is limited
to a few days, until the data is removed. This is not always very useful,
for example, when you want to look back further in time.

[@karwosts] came up with a solution for this, and the history dashboard now
combines the state history with the recorded long-term statistics, to provide
you insights into the past.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32912880/275918628-dea821b9-5449-4777-8f84-0524eecb0ff9.gif' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## Number feature for tile cards

The tile card is a very powerful card, and [@JosephAbbey] is even extending it
this release!

The tile card now has a "number" new feature you can use, that works number
entities and helpers. This allows you to control the number entity from the
tile card directly, and provides the choice to use it as a slider or as an
input with up/down buttons.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66320873/281064552-05269372-241b-453c-80e8-4706bbf7582d.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## Options for the default dashboard

The default dashboard Home Assitant generates for you, now has options that
will allow you to change the behavior of it. You can now configure the
default dashboard to hide certain areas, hide entities that don't belong
to an area and the option to hide the energy summary card.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-12/default-dashboard-options.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

This is a first step in making the dashboards configurable. When adding a
new dashboard, we will now also give you to option to start with an empty
one, or create a new default dashboard.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/282859942-d29c0716-d496-49be-bbfe-493e9215efcb.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

## More to-do!

The first iteration for support for to-do lists was added in the [last release](/blog/2023/11/01/release-202311/#there-is-a-lot-to-do),
and there has been continued work on this feature to expand it further.

First of all, there are two new services available:

- A new service to list all items on a to-do list (`todo.get_items`).
- A new service to remove completed items from a to-do list (`todo.remove_completed_items`).

Also, when viewing a to-do list from the Home Assistant interface, you can
now copy/paste or bookmark the URL, which will always bring you back to the
same to-do list.

Additionally, the to-do list now supports due dates and descriptions. However,
this is only available manually using services, there is no UI support for it
yet, however, that is being worked on.

Lastly, integration started to add support for the to-do list feature. For example,
the [CalDAV] integration now supports adding to-do items to your CalDAV server, and
with [Picnic] and [OurGroceries] you can now manage your shopping list. In case
of Picnic, it will even look up the product you add to your shopping list and
add the product in your shopping cart.

[Picnic]: /integrations/picnic
[OurGroceries]: /integrations/ourgroceries

## Re-import blueprints

If you use Blueprints, [created by our awesome community](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints/38),
you might have noticed that when you import a blueprint, it will not update
when the blueprint is updated. And the only option you had was to manually
adjust the YAML of the blueprint to make it match the latest version published
by the author.

As of this release, we want to provide a small improvement to this. Imported
blueprints will now show a button to re-import the blueprint from the source
you imported it from. This will overwrite the blueprint in your Home Assistant
instance with the latest version.

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/286546997-aae00d21-f8c6-448f-ae88-7bd3d3d0c0aa.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

<img class="no-shadow" src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/285043706-3a32fcb0-fbac-4f35-83f9-825c922c7b11.png' alt='Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.'>

**Please note**: This feature will overwrite your existing Blueprint with the latest
version published by the author. If you have made changes to the blueprint, or
the newer version of the blueprint is not compatible with your current setup,
your automations or script might need manual adjustments.

## Other noteworthy changes

There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- We have a brand new [trigger selector] for you to use in your Blueprints
  and scripts. Thanks, [@piitaya]!
- That is not all for selectors, [@schelv] added support for Kelvin to the
  [color temperature selector]. Nice!
- If you use the [IKEA IDÅSEN] desk, you will now have an height sensor!
  Thanks [@abmantis]!
- The [ESPHome] integration had many performance improvements, making it faster
  and more reliable. Thanks [@bdraco]!
- [@Lash-L] added support for displaying maps from your [Roborock] vacuums!
  Awesome!
- Services with response now support handling responses when multiple entities
  are targeted. Nice! Thanks [@eifinger]!
- The [ViCare] received tons of love from [@CFenner], keep up the good work!
- The media browser now has support for toggling between grid and list view.
  Thanks [@karwosts]!
- [@emontnemery] worked hard to improve all error messages that originate from
  manual YAML configuration. The messages should now be more detailed, more
  readable, and point out correctly which file and file line the error is
  located at. Awesome!
- [@karwosts] created a UI when you want to add selectors to your script field!
  Very nicely done!
- Error shown by Home Assistant, can now be translated! While tons of places,
  still need to adopt this, it is a big and user-friendly step forward!
  Outstanding job [@jbouwh]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Calendar" %}

`calendar.list_events` uses an outdated response data format and is now
deprecated, pending for removal in Home Assistant 2024.6.

Please use `calendar.get_events`, which supports multiple entities, instead.

([@eifinger] - [#102481]) ([documentation](/integrations/calendar))

[@eifinger]: https://github.com/eifinger
[#102481]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/102481

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Counter" %}

The previously deprecated `counter.configure` service has been removed.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#103204]) ([documentation](/integrations/counter))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#103204]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/103204

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DSMR" %}

DSMR entities will not automatically update on each received DSMR telegram
when the value between telegrams has not changed.

If you rely on this, for example, for graphing, please refer to the
[statistics integration](/integrations/statistics/).

([@gigatexel] - [#104037]) ([documentation](/integrations/dsmr))

For users using the 5B version: The previous gas sensor (Gas consumption)
will change to Gas consumption mbusX. Also multiple gas sensors will be possible.

[@dupondje]: https://github.com/dupondje
[#84097]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/84097

{% enddetails %}

{% details "EZVIZ" %}

The previously depreacted detection sensitivity service has been removed.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#103392]) ([documentation](/integrations/ezviz))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#103392]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/103392

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Home Assistant API" %}

When calling a service from the Home Assistant REST API, the service used to be
cancelled on connection drop. If you relied on that behavior, you would need
to revisit the logic. With this change, a connection drop will not cancel
the service call.

Also, a REST post to call a service with the `/api/services/<domain>/<service>`
endpoint will no longer timeout after 10 seconds.

[#104709]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/104709

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeWizard Energy" %}

The HomeWizard HWE-SKE (the wall plugs), SDM230, and SDM630 provided duplicate
sensors for energy import and export: A total and a tariff of 1.

As there is only a single tariff available on those, the total and tariff 1
are always the same. To clean this up, tariff 1 has been removed.

If you used this sensor in your energy dashboard, you will need to configure
your energy dashboard to use the total import/export sensor instead.

([@frenck] - [#104493]) ([documentation](/integrations/homewizard))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#104493]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/104493

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nibe Heat Pump" %}

S-Series entities priority-3102, hot-water-demand-mode-40057 and oper-mode-40238
is changed from a number entity to a select entity with mapping values for the
possible choices.

If you have the old number entities enabled, you can delete them since they
will no longer be provided by the integration.

([@elupus] - [#103788]) ([documentation](/integrations/nibe_heatpump))

[@elupus]: https://github.com/elupus
[#103788]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/103788

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Open Exchange Rates" %}

Remove rounding of the exchange rate.

Exchange rates are generally more sensitive to small changes and some quotes
need many decimal numbers to be accurate. The Open Exchange Rates service will
provide different number of significant digits for different quotes.

You can change the display precision or use a template sensor if you want
to customize the rounding of the value.

([@MartinHjelmare] - [#103972]) ([documentation](/integrations/openexchangerates))

[@MartinHjelmare]: https://github.com/MartinHjelmare
[#103972]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/103972

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ping" %}

The option to set a custom polling interval has been removed. If you are using
custom interval and really need it, you can use the `homeassistant.update_entity`
in an automation to poll at your custom pace. See our documentation on
[defining a custom polling interval](/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval)
for more information.

[@jpbede]: https://github.com/jpbede
[#103743]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/103743

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SMTP" %}

The SMTP integration will send images as attachments to a plain text email
instead of HTML in-line when the `html` field is not set.

Previous behavior was to send all images as HTML in-line even when the `html`
field was not set. To continue sending images as in-line, please set the
optional `html` field and include the images
as `<img src="cid:image_name.ext">` within the HTML block as described in the
[documentation](/integrations/smtp/#usage).

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Trafikverket Weather Station" %}

Trafikverket Weather has changed its endpoint and is no longer providing the
information for wind direction and precipitation in plain text so
therefore these sensors has been removed.

- Wind direction text
- Precipitation name
