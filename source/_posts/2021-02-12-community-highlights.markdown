The 8th edition of the Home Assistant Community Highlights! Some interesting
things popped up around our community, we thought was worth sharing. But first of all, 
I would like to introduce myself and say Hello! Because itâ€™s no longer Frenck who 
writes the community highlights, but a new person.

My name is Klaas Schoute, 25 years old (almost 26 ðŸ¥³) and living in the Netherlands. Currently, Iâ€™m
studying interaction technology at the university of applied sciences in Leiden and
from this week until the summer Iâ€™m doing an internship at Nabu Casa.

In the coming period, I will be working on energy measurements: what ways there are to
measure energy, which insights you can gain from it and how you could optimize consumption.

## Control your home from a StreamDeck

Especially the streamers "among us" will really enjoy this! There is now a way to operate
your Home Assistant using the buttons on a StreamDeck but also display certain sensor values.

How cool is this!

## ESPHome update

Quite recently ESPHome has received a new update (1.16.0), with a lot of new hardware support.
From now on, you will also be able to expect more frequent updates, as they have adopted a monthly release cycle.

## Mechanical sculptures

jessecakeindustries shared a nice vintage project on the [Home Assistant subreddit][reddit] and
wonders whether there might be a market for these kinds of products. Quite a funny device
to remind yourself in certain situations ðŸ™‚

Who else would want one in the house?

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/l1w4gh/is_there_a_market_for_bespoke_home_automation/">Is there a market for bespoke home automation components? You may recall I built this interface to our home that speaks, rings, and lights regular alerts. It has tasmota at its heart so is hardware based and easily interfaced with Home Assistant. Is there a market for me to make this kind of thing?</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant">r/homeassistant</a>
