Home Assistant Core 2023.2! üéâ

This release covers the first month of development of 2023, and it is setting
one heck of a high bar for the rest of the year! üòÖ

Undoubtedly, the most spectacular features are related to the
[first chapter of Year of the Voice](/blog/2023/01/26/year-of-the-voice-chapter-1/). üéôÔ∏è
It is hard to sum up all of this in this release blog, so I'm not even going
to try doing it in this introduction, but holy mother of smart homes: this is
exciting stuff! üòÆ

My personal favorite this release: huge steps into an even tighter integration
with our amazing sister project: [ESPHome](https://esphome.io). Creating
and maintaining your own secure DIY IoT devices just became a lot easier.

And since we are talking about awesomeness, have you noticed the large amount
of logos in the release image above? So many new integrations! ü§©

Enjoy the release!

../Frenck

_PS: Just a reminder that valentine's day is coming up. Be sure to share the love! ‚ù§Ô∏è_

## Meet: Assist!

It's [Home Assistant's Year of the Voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/), and
it's our goal to let users control Home Assistant in their own language.
Together with the Home Assistant community, we have been hard at work building
the foundation for this.

Today we like you to meet:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-02/assist.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new assist feature being used to turn on lights'>

<img src='/images/assist/assist-icon.svg' alt='Assist icon' style='height: 32px' class='no-shadow'> Assist
allows you to use natural language to control Home Assistant. It is powered by
[Hassil](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassil) and the sentences
(contributed by 112! people) from the
[Home Assistant Intents](https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/) project.

We believe technology is meant to be played with, and projects should be
usable as soon as possible. Together with the community, we can then iterate
and refine. That's why today, we're delivering a basic experience supporting
a stunning 22! languages that work with Assist.

Go ahead, it is enabled by default; just tap the new Assist icon
<img src='/images/assist/assist-icon.svg' alt='Assist icon' style='height: 32px' class='no-shadow'>
at the top right of your dashboard to start using it.

Oh, and we are also releasing some fun stuff we've cooked up along the way!
[Read more about Assist](/voice_control/) and other released voice features in the
[Chapter 1: Assist](/blog/2023/01/26/year-of-the-voice-chapter-1/) blogpost
and a [video presentation (including live demos) on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/ixgNT3RETPg).

<lite-youtube videoid="ixgNT3RETPg" videotitle="Year of the Voice - Chapter 1"></lite-youtube>

## Streaming history

History cards now update live! We now stream the state changes while they are
happening and update the graphs in real-time üò≤

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-02/streaming-history-cards.gif' alt='Screenshot showing a history card presenting the power usage of a kitchen coffeemaker, updating live while brewing coffee'></a>
These history cards now show live power usage, while I'm brewing a cup of coffee.
</p>

But this isn't just limited to history cards, your
{% my history title="history dashboard" %} is now live too!

As a result of this all, we can now write less frequently to the database in our
recorder. It took years of changes to get us to this point (thanks [@bdraco] üôè).
It greatly reduces resource usage and increases storage lifetimes significantly.
The previously introduced live logbook and now the live history were the
last pieces that made this possible.

As a side-effect, it should also resolve the authentication errors some people
experienced re-opening the iOS companion app when using history cards.

## Grouping sensors

The [group helper](/integrations/group) now supports sensors too! Sensor groups
can combine entities with a numeric state, like [sensors](/integrations/sensor),
[number](/integrations/number), and [number helpers](/integrations/input_number)
entities.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-02/sensor-groups.png' alt='Screenshot showing the process of adding a new sensor group'>

{% my config_flow_start badge domain="group" %}

This feature is a revised, improved, and more logical version of the
"Min/Max" integration / "Combine the state of several sensors" helper.
It is likely we are going to replace those with this new sensor group
in the future.

Compared to those previously mentioned methods, the sensor groups have the
additional options to hide their member entities and the option to ignore
sensors that currently are not in a numeric state (i.e., currently "unavailable"
or "unknown").

## Now even tighter integrated with ESPHome

[ESPHome](https://esphome.io) already works really well with Home Assistant.
Yet, this release makes it even better!

If you are using the ESPHome add-on, we have some great improvements for you.
The add-on and Home Assistant will now communicate with each other, bringing
in many new features.

When you set up a new device in ESPHome and next add it to Home Assistant,
they will be able to exchange encryption keys. Removing the need for you to
find, copy & paste those. Just a single click and the setup is done! üöÄ

But that is not all. What is really mind-blowing, is that the ESPHome
integration will now provide update entities when using the add-on!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-02/esphome-update-entities.png' alt='Screenshots, left one showing pending updates for ESPHome devices. Right one: an ESPHome device installing an update straight from Home Assistant'>

Right now, the update entities will only indicate if a device needs updating.
However, when the next major release of ESPHome (2023.2) becomes available,
it will support updating them too! Yes, at that point, you can update your
ESPHome devices directly from Home Assistant and even automate it!

Also, ESPHome is deprecating the old password-based authentication for its
API in favor of the more secure encryption key. If one of your ESPHome devices
is still using a plain password, Home Assistant will notify you by creating
an issue in your {% my repairs title="Repairs dashboard" %}.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-02/esphome-repairs-encryption-key.png' alt='Screenshot showing a raised repair issue for an ESPHome device still using the deprecated API password instead of an API encryption key'>

We've also prepared for the next release of ESPHome (2023.2), in which you can
add a friendly, more human name to your ESPHome devices. Home Assistant will
pick those up, making your ESPHome devices look better out-of-the-box!

## Other noteworthy changes

There is much more juice in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- You can now add aliases to your areas too! Our new Assist feature
  leverages this.
- Got an energy sensor in `Wh`, but you'd like it to be `kWh`? You can now
  change the units of energy sensors in the entity settings.
- Each entity in the frontend has its own color, which is based on the current
  entity state. We now have [officially added support](/integrations/frontend/#state-color)
  for themes to customize these.
- The most awesome integration of all, got even better. [@Lash-L] added support
  for the battery state of your [Oral-B] toothbrush!
- The automations & scripts UI now support selecting other entities for
  above/below in the numeric state conditions & triggers. Thanks, [@karwosts]!
- The [Reolink] integration now supports FLV streams, cameras can be discovered
  on the network, but more importantly: binary sensors! For things
  like motion, person, vehicle detection, and... Doorbell presses!
  Thanks, [@starkillerOG]!
- There is now a [service] that allows for the creation of calendar events. So,
  you can now automate events to be added to your calendars! Amazing, [@allenporter]!
- When selecting multiple entities from a list in the UI, it will now exclude
  already added entities. No more accidentally added duplicates! Thanks, [@piitaya]!
- [@Kane610] added PoE power sensors to the [UniFi Network] integrations, nice!
- The [Tile card] now has a vertical option! Great, [@TheZoker]!
- [Jellyfin] now works with TV shows in the media browser. Thanks, [@j-stienstra]!
- We have bumped the CHIP/Matter SDK version used by our [Matter] implementation
  to 1.0.0.2, which [contains many fixes].
- From the Month of "What the heck?": Old-style [groups] can now remove entities
  from the group using the `group.set` service. Thanks, [@gjohansson-ST]!
- You might have noticed a [Thread] and an [Open Thread Border Router] integration
  being added to this release. These are currently not for active use but for
  initial early development.
- The experimental multi-pan feature has been enabled again. Allowing to run
  both Zigbee and Thread using the single radio found in both Home Assistant
  Yellow and Home Assistant SkyConnect.
- The following integrations now reached a [Platinum] level on the
  [integration quality scale]:
  - [Renault] excellent job [@epenet]!
  - [HomeWizard Energy] awesome work [@DCSBL]!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "Python 3.9 support has been removed" %}

Python 3.9 support has previously been deprecated and has now been removed.
Home Assistant now requires Python 3.10 to run.

If you are using Home Assistant OS, Home Assistant Container, or Home Assistant
Supervised installation method, you don‚Äôt have to do anything. In those cases,
we handle this all for you.

Your system has been using Python 3.10 for quite some time already.

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#85456]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85456

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MariaDB" %}

If you are using MariaDB with Home Assistant recorder, please make sure
you run `10.5.17` , `10.6.9`, `10.7.5`, `10.8.4` (depending on which major
release you are using). If you are using the MariaDB core add-on,
make sure to update it to the latest version: `2.5.2`.

Older versions of MariaDB suffer from a significant performance regression
when retrieving history data or purging the database.

([@bdraco] - [#87040])

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#87040]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/87040

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Automations & Scripts" %}

A disabled condition, for example, in an automation or script, will no longer
always be a pass/`True` within an `OR` condition. Instead, in those
cases, the condition will now have no effect when disabled.

([@karliemeads] - [#79718]) ([documentation](/integrations/automations))

[@karliemeads]: https://github.com/karliemeads
[#79718]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/79718

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AccuWeather" %}

For the precipitation entity, the unit was changed from `mm` to `mm/h`
(`in` to `in/h`), resulting in the need to fix the unit for long-term
statistics. You can do that in `Developer Tools` -> `Stats`.

([@bieniu] - [#86088]) ([documentation](/integrations/accuweather))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#86088]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86088

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Airly" %}

If the language in the Home Assistant settings is set to Polish, the language
of the `advice` and `description` attributes of the CAQI entity will change
from English to Polish.

If you are using these in your automations or scripts, you might need to adjust
them to match this change.

([@bieniu] - [#85655]) ([documentation](/integrations/airly))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#85655]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85655

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Fitbit" %}

The state values of the Fitbit sensor entities will change to remove any
thousands delimiters. For example, `1,500` will become `1500`.

If you're using the state of these entities in automations or scripts,
you need to update them to handle the new state format.

([@sw-carlos-cristobal] - [#85251]) ([documentation](/integrations/fitbit))

[@sw-carlos-cristobal]: https://github.com/sw-carlos-cristobal
[#85251]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85251

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Flume" %}

The scan/update interval for water values has been restored to match the Flume
app.

To stay under Flume's API limits, the device connection is now checked hourly,
and notifications are checked every 5 minutes.

([@bdraco] - [#86354]) ([documentation](/integrations/flume))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#86354]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86354

{% enddetails %}

{% details "History" %}

The `use_include_order` YAML configuration option has been removed.

This option was used to sort the history on the original history panel which,
is no longer used. As it no longer has a function and only serves to
slow down the response, it has been removed.

([@bdraco] - [#86365]) ([documentation](/integrations/history))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#86365]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86365

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IoTaWatt" %}

The IoTAWatt integration no longer provides sensors with the "Accumulated"
suffix. The accumulated sensors have been introduced to support net energy
export/import metering.

Newer versions of IoTaWatt provide "Integrators", which allow achieving the
same more efficiently and with higher accuracy.

You should configure [Integrators](https://docs.iotawatt.com/en/master/integrators.html)
to calculate the net energy export and import.

([@agners] - [#86611]) ([documentation](/integrations/iotawatt))

[@agners]: https://github.com/agners
[#86611]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86611

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Matter" %}

The Matter integration now requires running Matter Server version `2.0.0`.

If you're using the Matter Server add-on to run the Matter Server,
you will need version `3.0.0` of the add-on.

We had to change our vendor ID in the add-on; as a result, all devices
need to be recommissioned.

([@MartinHjelmare] - [#86470]) ([documentation](/integrations/matter))

[@MartinHjelmare]: https://github.com/MartinHjelmare
[#86470]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86470

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nettigo Air Monitor" %}

The states of air quality sensors have been standardized to match Home Assistant
core rules. This affects two states of the sensors that NAM can provide:

- `very low`, which now became `very_low`
- `very high`, which now became `very_high`

If you used those states directly in your automations, scripts, or templates;
you would need to adjust those to match these changes.

([@frenck] - [#85245]) ([documentation](/integrations/nam))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#85245]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85245

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

The Pentair ScreenLogic integration now correctly categorizes all known lights.
Removing any lights that were previously incorrectly created as switch entities
may be necessary.

([@dieselrabbit] - [#86608]) ([documentation](/integrations/screenlogic))

[@dieselrabbit]: https://github.com/dieselrabbit
[#86608]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/86608

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pi-hole" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Pi-hole
integration has been removed.

Pi-hole is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML configuration
has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely removed from your
YAML configuration files.

([@mib1185] - [#84803]) ([documentation](/integrations/pi_hole))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#84803]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/84803

---

The extra state attribute "Domains blocked" has been removed from all sensors.
It is already exposed as its own dedicated sensor.

If you used the state attribute in your automations or scripts, you would
need to adjust them to use the dedicated sensor instead.

([@mib1185] - [#85424]) ([documentation](/integrations/pi_hole))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#85424]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/85424

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Rain Bird" %}

Rainbird is now configured via the UI, and configuration from YAML has been
imported automatically.

However, there are a few notable changes:

- Custom per zone overrides for irrigation time are no longer supported.
- The Rain delay `binary_sensor` that duplicates the Rain delay time `sensor`
  has been removed. You should move all uses to the `sensor` value and check
  for a non-zero value to get equivalent behavior.
- The Rain `sensor` that duplicates the Rain `binary_sensor` has been removed.
  You may check the `binary_sensor` state to get equivalent behavior.

Also, the way the "Rain Delay" is managed has changed. The Rain Delay, which
pauses irrigation for a specified number of days, is now managed with a `number`
entity which can be controlled directly from the UI.

The existing service call `rainbird.set_rain_delay` and the Raindelay sensor
have been deprecated. Any existing automations or scripts that make service
calls to `rainbird.set_rain_delay` will need to be replaced with a call
to `number.set_value`. Additionally, the existing service call was updated to
require an integration entry configuration since it previously had undefined
behavior, so it is recommended to move directly to the new number service call.

{% details "Recorder" %}

The recorder's default commit interval has been increased to 5 seconds to
reduce disk I/O and increase storage longevity.

As the history and logbook integrations both support live streaming, which
avoids the need to read the database after the initial sync, there is no
remaining core functionality that needs a lower commit interval.

The [`commit_interval`](/integrations/recorder/#commit_interval) can be adjusted
to a lower value in the event an integration has not been updated to watch for
events instead of reading the database and needs to read the database sooner.

{% details "Sony Bravia TV" %}

Sony Bravia TV media players no longer have fake (assumed) `playing` or `paused`
states, and those are replaced with the `on` state.

If you have automations or scripts that use the `playing` or `paused` state,
please update them to be compatible with this change.

---

The `source_list` no longer contains a list of applications and TV channels.
Apps and channels have been separated from the input list and moved
to the Media Browser.

If you have automations or scripts that use `media_player.select_source` to
switch apps or channels on the Bravia TV, the automations need to be
updated to use `media_player.play_media` service instead.

The options flow has been removed from the integration, as the only
configurable setting `ignored_sources` was no longer relevant
and incompatible with this change.

{% details "Tado" %}

The swing modes of Tado have changed. This is to standardize with other
integrations, and so it can support translations.

- `ON` became the lowercase `on`
- `OFF` became the lowercase `off`

If you used these swing modes in your automations or scripts, you might
need to adjust those to this change.

{% details "Universal Devices ISY/IoX" %}

ISY/IoX Variables have been moved from `sensor` entities to `number` entities;
the existing `sensor` entities are deprecated and will be removed in a future
release.

The `isy994.set_variable` service has been deprecated in favor of using
the `number` entities to directly set the variable values.

Please update any dashboards, scripts, and automations that may be using these
entities or service.

Entities for INSTEON Aux Properties and Device Communication Errors have been
removed for nodes that are not the main (load) node.

On Level and Ramp Rate sensors have been removed for non-dimmable (non-`light.`)
devices. Only load devices receive communication error updates and only
dimmable devices support `OL` and `RR` commands.

The other entities were previously added but did not receive valid states from
the ISY or end-devices. These sensors were disabled by default.

{% details "Yamaha MusicCast" %}

The raw state/option values of the Yamaha MusicCast zone sleep `select` entities
have been standardized to match Home Assistant core rules.

- `90 min`, which now became `90_min`
- `60 min`, which now became `60_min`

If you used those states/options directly in your automations, scripts,
