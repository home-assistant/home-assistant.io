Home Assistant Core 2023.10! 🎉

October! 🎃 It means we've just celebrated our birthday; we are now 10 years old! 🎂 In case you've missed our
[birthday YouTube stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmLV6lJLzSU&t=2538s) with all the cool announcements, we've summed it all up in our [10 year Home Assistant blog post](/blog/2023/09/17/10-years-home-assistant/).

Even more exciting news, as this is [Home Assistant's year of the voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/): Chapter 4 of this endeavor has been announced and will be [streamed live on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzgYYkOrnhQ) on 12 October 2023, at 12:00 PDT / 21:00 CEST! Be sure to tune in! I've seen some early demos... All I'm going to say is: It is mind-blowing! 🤯

As for this release, because of all of the above, it is a bit smaller than usual in terms of features. I promise that chapter 4 is going to make it all worth it. Yet, it contains tons of updates, bug fixes, and a couple of beautiful new features for the Tile card! 🤩

Enjoy the release!

## A beautiful updated logo!

In case you've missed it, we have refreshed the Home Assistant logo! 🤩

<img class='no-shadow' src='/images/blog/2023-09-ha10/home-assistant-logo-new.png' alt='The new Home Assistant logo on a gray background.'>

This was done for the [10th anniversary of Home Assistant](/blog/2023/09/17/10-years-home-assistant/), and you can [read all about this iteration in this blog post](/blog/2023/09/17/a-refreshed-logo-for-home-assistant/). You will start seeing this logo in many more places in the upcoming weeks, but, it is already included this release!

## New tile features for climate

Last release, we added [lots of new features for the Tile card](/blog/2023/09/06/release-20239/#lots-of-new-tile-features),
including features specifically for controlling your climate devices. This release, we are adding even more!

[@Weissnix4711] contributed a feature that allows you to add buttons for the presets of your climate device to the tile card.

<p class='img'>

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

[@piitaya] took it a step further and added the ability to select which presets you want to show, and allow showing them in a dropdown list instead of series of buttons.

## Tile card select feature

But there is more goodness for the Tile card this release. [@piitaya] added a select feature to the tile card, allowing you to select an option from a list of options.

This feature can be used for any `select` entity, but also for your dropdown helpers! (also known as `input_select` entities).

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Map entity markers options

The [map card](/dashboards/map/), received new options for your entity markers that are shown on the map.

For example, you can now choose if you want the entity name to be rendered on
the map, or the entity state but you could also override the name all together.
You can now also exclude entities to be not taking into account when centering
the map.

## Password managers and Home Assistant

There has been a long standing issue with using password managers with the Home Assistant login.
This release addresses this issue:

## Breaking changes

{% details "HomeKit Bridge" %}

The HomeKit integration now supports media player receivers. HomeKit expects
receivers to be paired in accessory mode. Existing receivers paired in bridge
mode should be re-added in [accessory mode](/integrations/homekit/#accessory-mode).

([@bdraco] - [#100717]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#100717]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/100717

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

The `close_comm_on_error` configuration is no longer optional, sockets will
always be closed on error. Therefore, the `close_comm_on_error` is now
deprecated and will be removed in Home Assistant 2024.3.

([@janiversen] - [#99946]) ([documentation](/integrations/modbus))

[@janiversen]: https://github.com/janiversen
[#99946]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/99946

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

An MQTT lock with a configured state topic will initialize with state
`unknown` instead of state `unlocked` unless the lock is set to optimistic mode.

MQTT locks set to optimistic mode will still be initialized with
the `unlocked` state. You should check if your automations are affected.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "NZBGet" %}

The option to set a custom scan interval in NZBGet via the options UI has been
removed. The update interval is now every 5 seconds.

If you want to restore the custom scan interval behavior,
please see [the `homeassistant.update_entity` service](/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval).

[#98869]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98869

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenTherm Gateway" %}

Some of the older binary sensors and sensors from the OpenTherm gateway have
been deprecated since January 2021. They have now been removed. Please use
the new binary sensors and sensors that have been created since.

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#99712]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/99712

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

Some entity names have changed. The integration will migrate old entities
to new names/IDs. You may have to manually update old entities used
in, for example, your dashboards.

Invalid entities such as "Saturation Index" are removed
if the required equipment is not configured.

([@dieselrabbit] - [#92475]) ([documentation](/integrations/screenlogic))

[@dieselrabbit]: https://github.com/dieselrabbit
[#92475]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92475

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Supervisor" %}

The default name given to backups created with the `hassio.full_backup`
and `hassio.partial_backup` services are no longer the UTC date and time the
backup was initiated but use the local date and time instead.

([@jpbede] - [#100959]) ([documentation](/integrations/hassio))

[@jpbede]: https://github.com/jpbede
[#100959]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/100959

{% enddetails %}

Multiple WebSocket commands have been renamed based on [this change in Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v12?id=renamed-network-heal-to-rebuild-routes).

With this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance.
You must use zwave-js-server `1.32.0` or greater (schema `32`).

  - If you use the Z-Wave JS add-on, you need at least version `0.1.91`.

  - If you use the Z-Wave JS UI Docker container, you need at least version `9.0.0`.
