Home Assistant Core 2023.10! ðŸŽ‰

October! ðŸŽƒ It means we've just celebrated our birthday; we are now 10 years old! ðŸŽ‚ In case you've missed our
[birthday YouTube stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmLV6lJLzSU) with all the cool announcements, we've summed it all up in our [10 year Home Assistant blog post](/blog/2023/09/17/10-years-home-assistant/).

Even more exciting news, as this is [Home Assistant's year of the voice](/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/): Chapter 4 of this endeavor has been announced and will be [streamed live on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzgYYkOrnhQ) on 12 October 2023, at 12:00 PDT / 21:00 CEST! Be sure to tune in! I've seen some early demos... All I'm going to say is: It is mind-blowing! ðŸ¤¯

As for this release, because of all of the above, it is a bit smaller than usual in terms of features. I promise that chapter 4 is going to make it all worth it. Yet, it contains tons of updates, bug fixes, and a couple of beautiful new features for the tile card! ðŸ¤©

Enjoy the release!

## A beautiful updated logo!

In case you've missed it, we have refreshed the Home Assistant logo! ðŸ¤©

<img class='no-shadow' src='/images/blog/2023-09-ha10/home-assistant-logo-new.png' alt='The new Home Assistant logo on a gray background.'>

This was done for the [10th anniversary of Home Assistant](/blog/2023/09/17/10-years-home-assistant/), and you can [read all about this iteration in this blog post](/blog/2023/09/17/a-refreshed-logo-for-home-assistant/). You will start seeing this logo in many more places in the upcoming weeks, but, it is already included this release!

<img class='no-shadow' src='/images/blog/2023-10/home-assistant-about.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new logo showing on the about page in the Home Assistant interface.'>

## Brand new My Home Assistant buttons

It is not just the logo that got a facelift; we have beautiful new buttons for [My Home Assistant] as well ðŸ¤©.

<center>
<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io" target="_blank"><img class='no-shadow' src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/homeassistant.svg' alt='My Home Assistant logo as a button'></a>
</center><br />

If you're unfamiliar with My Home Assistant, it's a free online tool that enables websites, documentation, chat platforms, and blogs to link to places on your Home Assistant server without knowing its address or being exposed to the internet. This ensures your privacy while still allowing a seamless experience.

In our documentation, you'll find those buttons to, for example, add a new integration to your Home Assistant with a single click! Try it yourself! This button below will open up your Home Assistant's interface and show the integrations
you have installed:

<center>

{% my integrations badge %}

</center>

So, if you see these buttons showing up somewhere, you now know what they do! You can easily create your own buttons and links to share on the [create link] page.

## New tile card features for climate entities

In the last release, we added [lots of new features for the tile card](/blog/2023/09/06/release-20239/#lots-of-new-tile-features),
including features specifically for controlling your climate devices. This release, we are adding even more!

[@Weissnix4711] contributed a feature that allows you to add buttons for the presets of your climate device to the tile card. Next, [@piitaya] took it a step further: You can now select which presets you want to show and if you want them in a dropdown list instead of a series of buttons.

<img class='no-shadow' src='/images/blog/2023-10/tile-card-climate-presets.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new preset feature of the tile cards in both button and dropdown variants.'>

The screenshot above shows the same tile card, but one with the buttons and one with the dropdown.

In the options for this tile card feature, you'll be given the choice if you
prefer to show icons or if you rather have a dropdown. You can also pick
which presets you want to show/hide.

[@Weissnix4711]: https://github.com/Weissnix4711

## Tile card feature select entities

But there is more goodness for the tile card. [@piitaya] also added the dropdown from above as a feature for the select entities, allowing you to select an option from a list of options.

<img class='no-shadow' src='/images/blog/2023-10/tile-card-select.png' alt='Screenshot showing the select feature for the tile card in the Home Assistant interface.'>

This feature can be used for any select entity but also your custom dropdown helpers! (also known as `input_select` entities).

## Password managers and Home Assistant

Using a password manager is arguably one of the best things you can do to
improve your online security. But using them with Home Assistant, depending on
which one you have been using, has been a bit of a pain.

If you've been using one of these password managers that had issues with
Home Assistant, you'll be happy to know that this release fixes that!
For example, 1Password now works!

<img class='no-shadow' src='/images/blog/2023-10/home-assistant-works-with-1password.png' alt='Screenshot from the Home Assistant login screen, that show the use of 1Password'>

## Map entity marker options

The [map card](/dashboards/map/) received new options (thanks [@karwosts]!)
for your entity markers that are shown on the map.

You can now choose if you want the entity name to be rendered on the map
or the entity state, but you could also override the name altogether. You could,
for example, show state values, instead of the name, for the entities providing
gas prices, so you can see where the cheapest gas is.

<center>
<img class='no-shadow' src='/images/blog/2023-10/map-features-prices.png' alt='Screenshot of a map card showing gas prices on the map.'>
</center><br />

When centering the map, all entities on the map are taken into account.
However, you can also exclude certain entities (for example,
known outliers) that should not be considered when doing that.

This is currently only available in the YAML configuration of the map card.
See our [documentation for the map card](/dashboards/map/#label_mode) for
more information.

  backups when you have [the latest version] installed!

  easier to set up and now also works with the [Home Assistant Cloud] webhooks
  for push updates!

- [@alexyao2015] added a button to [Life360] to trigger a poll to update the

  or stretched into the displayed card. Thanks [@karwosts]!
- It's now easier than ever to collect [Z-Wave] logs for troubleshooting.
  Just [enable debug logging](/integrations/zwave_js#how-do-i-access-the-z-wave-logs)!

## Backward-incompatible changes

{% details "HomeKit Bridge" %}

The HomeKit integration now supports media player receivers. HomeKit expects
receivers to be paired in accessory mode. Existing receivers paired in bridge
mode should be re-added in [accessory mode](/integrations/homekit/#accessory-mode).

([@bdraco] - [#100717]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#100717]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/100717

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

The `close_comm_on_error` configuration is no longer optional, sockets will
always be closed on error. Therefore, the `close_comm_on_error` is now
deprecated and will be removed in Home Assistant 2024.3.

([@janiversen] - [#99946]) ([documentation](/integrations/modbus))

[@janiversen]: https://github.com/janiversen
[#99946]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/99946

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

An MQTT lock with a configured state topic will initialize with state
`unknown` instead of state `unlocked` unless the lock is set to optimistic mode.

MQTT locks set to optimistic mode will still be initialized with
the `unlocked` state. You should check if your automations are affected.

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#100943]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/100943

{% enddetails %}

{% details "NZBGet" %}

The option to set a custom scan interval in NZBGet via the options UI has been
removed. The update interval is now every 5 seconds.

If you want to restore the custom scan interval behavior,
please see [the `homeassistant.update_entity` service](/common-tasks/general/#defining-a-custom-polling-interval).

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#98869]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98869

{% enddetails %}

{% details "OpenTherm Gateway" %}

Some of the older binary sensors and sensors from the OpenTherm gateway have
been deprecated since January 2021. They have now been removed. Please use
the new binary sensors and sensors that have been created since.

([@joostlek] - [#99712]) ([documentation](/integrations/opentherm_gw))

[@joostlek]: https://github.com/joostlek
[#99712]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/99712

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

Some entity names have changed. The integration will migrate old entities
to new names/IDs. You may have to manually update old entities used
in, for example, your dashboards.

Invalid entities such as "Saturation Index" are removed
if the required equipment is not configured.

[@dieselrabbit]: https://github.com/dieselrabbit
[#92475]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92475

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Supervisor" %}

The default name given to backups created with the `hassio.full_backup`
and `hassio.partial_backup` services are no longer the UTC date and time the
backup was initiated. Instead, the local date and time are used for the name.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Twitch" %}

Any existing app you have created in the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/) to work with this integration must be updated to work with Home Assistant's UI authentication flow. Update the app's configuration to include `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth` in its list of "OAuth Redirect URLs"

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

Multiple WebSocket commands have been renamed based on [this change in Z-Wave JS](https://zwave-js.github.io/node-zwave-js/#/getting-started/migrating-to-v12?id=renamed-network-heal-to-rebuild-routes).

With this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance.
You must use zwave-js-server `1.32.0` or greater (schema `32`).

  - If you use the Z-Wave JS add-on, you need at least version `0.1.91`.
  - If you use the Z-Wave JS UI add-on, you need at least version `2.0.0`.
  - If you use the Z-Wave JS UI Docker container, you need at least version `9.0.0`.
  - If you run your own Docker container or some other installation method,
    you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance to at least `1.32.0`.
