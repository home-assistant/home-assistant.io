<a href='/integrations/#version/2022.3'><img src='/images/blog/2022-03/social.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

Did you know that today - March 2nd - in 1949, the first automatic street
light was lit in New Milford, Connecticut, USA? Seventy-three years later, we
automate our entire homes 😎

Home Assistant Core 2022.3! And this release has a different and fresh "tune"
to it! Yes, pun intended as this release brings tons of improvements
involving media.

And what is so cool about it? It is not just about browsing media,
it is even more about using it! Using media allows us to make the automations
in our home more "personal".

For example, having our favorite radio station playing when we get home
or broadcasting announcements and sound bites to our speakers to notify
us of stuff happening in and around our home. (I really need to install that
camera at the front door now 😅.)

What are you using media for?

Enjoy the release!

## Media Selector and the new "Play media" action

This release brings a new media selector and a "Play media" action.
These make it super easy to use media in your automations and scripts.

Choose the "Play media" action when creating an automation, select the media
player you'd like to play something on, and next... just browse and pick the
media that you want it to play! Done! 🚀

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/media-selector.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new media selector and play media action'>

Have you ever wanted to play your front door camera stream on your television
when the doorbell rings? Well, this is now very possible with this update.
Check out this video on how to set that up in only 1.5 minutes. 🤯

<div class='videoWrapper'>

</div>

## More media sources!

Of course, the above-shown “Play media” action and selector is incredible. But,
you'd need some media to select! We already supported local media
and things like Spotify, but wouldn't it be cool if we had more!?

So, this release will bring in a bunch of new media sources.

Your Cameras! Your Lovelace Dashboards! You can just pick one of your cameras
or Lovelace dashboards and "Play" them on a supported device
(like a Google Nest Hub or television). But also text to speech!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/pick-tts.png' alt='Screenshot showing playing TTS as a media action'>

But that's not it; we also have new integrations adding new media sources.
This release adds the [DLNA Digital Media Server] and [Radio Browser]
integrations that allow the use of their sources with your media players.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/radio-browser.png' alt='Screenshot showing the Radio Browser'>

You can browse and listen to thirty thousand radio stations from all
around the world. But what is even cooler is that with the new "Play media"
action in automations, you can just select your favorite radio station to be
playing when, for example, you arrive home!

## Upload your media straight from the browser

Getting your media files (pictures, images, soundbites, music) into your
local media folder required you to use the
{% my supervisor_addon addon="core_samba" title="Samba add-on" %} (or something
similar).

Can we improve this experience? Sure we can!

This release adds initial support for local media management straight from the
Home Assistant frontend, allowing you to upload and remove files directly.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/media-management.png' alt='Screenshot showing media management'>

## UI Upgrades

We have been working hard on upgrading the Home Assistant frontend to use
Material Web Components (MWC) everywhere, saying goodbye to our old
(and deprecated) paper style.

This allows our frontend to be up-to-date with the latest features and the
latest style. As you'll notice, these elements have a different look from the
older style, so don't be alarmed if your inputs look slightly different.

Updating to MWC gives us many new opportunities for the future and makes
Home Assistant more accessible, for example, when using a screen reader.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/mwc-vs-paper.png' alt='Screenshot showing the styling difference between MWC and paper style'>

The screenshot above shows the new MWC styling on the left and the previous
paper styling from an older Home Assistant version on the right. The styling
change mainly impacts input fields look and feel.

## Triggered!

When working an automation, triggers now show live in the UI when they are
triggering, allowing you to validate you set it up correctly.

In this little animation below, the remote is pressed a couple of times.
The automation editor will show the "TRIGGERED" bar.

<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/triggered.gif' alt='Screen recording showing automation triggers triggering showing in the UI'>
Each time the trigger triggers it will be indicated in the UI.
</p>

Additionally, you can now also trigger each individual action in your automation
to test if the action you are creating runs as expected:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/run-action.png' alt='Screenshot showing how to run an individual action from the automation editor'>

## Entity ID autocompletion

Our YAML configuration and Jinja templates used in, for example, automations,
scripts, and frontend dashboards can be a really powerful customization
tool. You can definitely appreciate this feature if you use our code editor
in the frontend at times.

Thanks to [@kubawolanin], we now have entity ID autocompletion when using
the built-in code editor in the Home Assistant frontend 😎.

Just start typing an entity ID, and the code editor will try to suggest an
entity ID and show the selected entity's current state.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-03/autocompletion.png' alt='Screenshot showing the code editor with entity ID autocompletion'>

## Breaking Changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Z-Wave / OpenZWave" %}

This breaking change does **NOT** apply to users of the [Z-Wave JS] integration.

This is a breaking change notice regarding the older [Z-Wave] and [OpenZWave]
integrations, which both have been previously deprecated.

This release of Home Assistant Core 2022.3 will be the final release that
provides these integrations. Both the old `zwave` and `ozw` integrations
are pending removal for Home Assistant Core 2022.4.

The `ozw` integration has been deprecated before as the upstream
projects we depends on, for e.g., libraries and add-on containers,
are no longer maintained.

As Home Assistant is moving towards support for Python 3.10, it became clear
that the old `zwave` integration isn't compatible and thus is going to
be removed for that reason.

If you are still running your Z-Wave network on either of those deprecated
integrations, we highly recommend migrating
to the newer [Z-Wave JS] integration after upgrading to this release.

The new [Z-Wave JS] will provide you with a modern, more feature-rich,
maintained, and stable Z-Wave stack for the future.

See our documentation for a guide on
[Migrating from previous Z-Wave implementations](/integrations/zwave_js/#migrating-from-previous-z-wave-implementations).

[OpenZWave]: /integrations/openzwave
[Z-Wave JS]: /integrations/zwave_js
[Z-Wave]: /integrations/zwave

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ASUSWRT" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the ASUSWRT
integration has been removed.

ASUSWRT is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@ollo69] - [#65904]) ([documentation](/integrations/asuswrt))

[@ollo69]: https://github.com/ollo69
[#65904]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65904

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!Box Call Monitor" %}

The AVM FRITZ!Box Call Monitor integration previously migrated to configuration
via the UI. Therefore, configuring the AVM FRITZ!Box Call Monitor integration
via YAML configuration has now been deprecated and will be removed
in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration has been automatically imported and
can be safely removed from your YAML configuration.

([@tkdrob] - [#61762]) ([documentation](/integrations/fritzbox_callmonitor))

[@tkdrob]: https://github.com/tkdrob
[#61762]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/61762

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ebusd" %}

A typo was fixed in the ebusd integration for monitored condition
`WaterPressure`. It is incorrectly named "WaterPreasure" in the code.

The [documentation](/integrations/ebusd/#waterpressure) represents the correct value.

([@nklebedev] - [#66355]) ([documentation](/integrations/ebusd))

[@nklebedev]: https://github.com/nklebedev
[#66355]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66355

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Elexa Guardian" %}

Elexa Guardian no longer accepts the previously deprecated `entity_id` parameter
in service calls; automations and scripts calling those services now require
a `device_id` parameter.

([@bachya] - [#65484]) ([documentation](/integrations/guardian))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#65484]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65484

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Freebox" %}

The `freebox.reboot` service is now deprecated and replaced by a dedicated
reboot `button` entity; please use that entity to reboot the Freebox instead.

([@epenet] - [#65501]) ([documentation](/integrations/freebox))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#65501]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65501

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IKEA TRÅDFRI" %}

The native IKEA Tradfri groups are now deprecated, and this feature will be
removed from the integration in a future release.

Tradfri groups rely on sending frequent requests (polling) to the gateway to
check the states of the groups. Continuously polling the gateway causes
stability issues of the gateway, sometimes causing it to crash and requiring
a restart. We propose using [light groups](/integrations/light.group/) instead.

Configuring IKEA Tradfri via YAML configuration has been deprecated and will
be removed in a future Home Assistant release. Any remaining YAML configuration
has been automatically imported for a long time and thus can be safely
removed from your YAML configuration.

([@ggravlingen] - [#65226]) ([documentation](/integrations/tradfri))

[@ggravlingen]: https://github.com/ggravlingen
[#65226]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65226

{% enddetails %}

{% details "International Space Station (ISS)" %}

The International Space Station (ISS) integration migrated to configuration
via the UI. Configuring International Space Station (ISS) via YAML configuration
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future Home Assistant release.

Your existing YAML configuration is automatically imported on upgrade to this
release; and thus can be safely removed from your YAML configuration
after upgrading.

([@DurgNomis-drol] - [#64987]) ([documentation](/integrations/iss))

[@DurgNomis-drol]: https://github.com/DurgNomis-drol
[#64987]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/64987

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT binary sensors, lights, fans, humidifiers, and switches can now have
an `unknown` state in case the state is unknown.

This change was made to make the MQTT entities more consistent with
how these entities behave in other parts of Home Assistant. You may need
to adapt your script and automations to this change.

([@jbouwh] - [#65183] [#65308] [#65301] [#65302] [#65294]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[#65308]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65308

---

An MQTT configuration in `configuration.yaml` no longer results in an
imported integration entry, MQTT must now be set up from the frontend.

Please note that:

- Any previously imported configuration is still valid, this PR does not
  remove or modify imported configurations.
- It's still possible to configure MQTT entities and advanced broker
  configurations, such as SSL certificates, via YAML.

([@emontnemery] - [#66160]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#66160]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66160

---

The MQTT climate `hold` and `away` mode configuration settings are now
deprecated and removed in Home Assistant Core 2022.9.0.

Please use the new `preset_mode` configuration options instead.

([@jbouwh] - [#66062]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#66062]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66062

---

Configuring basic MQTT broker options with YAML is now deprecated,
this affects the following configuration variables:

- `birth_message`
- `broker`
- `discovery`
- `password`
- `port`
- `username`
- `will_message`

Configuring those options can instead be done via the UI.

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#66247]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66247

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nest" %}

Older Nest cameras no longer use thumbnail images from events, and instead
always use the live stream.

You should use the newer [Nest Media Source APIs](/integrations/nest/#media-source)
to fetch media for events.

([@allenporter] - [#66427]) ([documentation](/integrations/nest))

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#66427]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66427

{% enddetails %}

{% details "NINA" %}

Districts of Hamburg and Berlin have been removed.
Alternatively, `Hamburg, Freie und Hansestadt` and `Berlin, Stadt` can be used.

([@DeerMaximum] - [#65914]) ([documentation](/integrations/nina))

[@DeerMaximum]: https://github.com/DeerMaximum
[#65914]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65914

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Overkiz (by Somfy)" %}

Previously, a Myfox Camera Shutter was mapped to a (non-functional) `cover`
entity. This is now changed to be a functional `switch` entity instead.

([@iMicknl] - [#66088]) ([documentation](/integrations/overkiz))

[@iMicknl]: https://github.com/iMicknl
[#66088]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66088

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Phone Modem" %}

The `modem_callerid.reject_call` has been deprecated and will be removed in
Home Assistant 2022.4.

The integration now provides a button entity that can be used instead.

If you have been using the `reject_call` service in your automation or scripts,
you will need to adopt those to this change.

([@tkdrob] - [#66742]) ([documentation](/integrations/modem_callerid))

[@tkdrob]: https://github.com/tkdrob
[#66742]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66742

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Picnic" %}

The sensors for the "last order ETA start/end" have been renamed to
"next delivery ETA start/end" and will now contain the ETA of the first
upcoming delivery.

If multiple deliveries are planned, the `next_delivery_*` sensors
contain information about the first upcoming delivery,
while the `last_order_*` sensors contain information
about the last-placed order.

([@corneyl] - [#66474]) ([documentation](/integrations/picnic))

[@corneyl]: https://github.com/corneyl
[#66474]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/6666474062

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Plugwise" %}

Changing the scan interval option of Plugwise devices in the integration
configuration has been removed. Home Assistant will, by default, use a sane
and safe interval.

If you, however, still need to customize the interval, you can do so by
disabling automatic updates for the integration and using an automation
to trigger on your preferred interval and call `homeassistant.update_entity`
service.

([@frenck] - [#65808]) ([documentation](/integrations/plugwise))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#65808]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65808

---

The Plugwise Auxiliary `sensor` entities for heating and cooling have been
removed and replaced by equivalent `binary_sensor` entities.

([@frenck] - [#66259]) ([documentation](/integrations/plugwise))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#66259]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66259

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Radarr" %}

The "Wanted" option for the Radarr integration has been removed, as this
was an invalid endpoint.

If you have this option configured in your YAML configuration, you will need
to remove it.

([@tkdrob] - [#63818]) ([documentation](/integrations/radarr))

[@tkdrob]: https://github.com/tkdrob
[#63818]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63818

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Renault" %}

Previously, Renault `binary_sensor` entities could have the
state `on` or `off`, and in case the endpoint was unreachable: `unavailable`.

However, it wasn't able to have the `unknown` state, which has been added.

So, a `binary_sensor` entity can now have the `on`, `off`, `unavailable`,
or `unknown` state.

You might need to adapt your automations or scripts to account this new
`unknown` state.

([@epenet] - [#65997]) ([documentation](/integrations/renault))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#65997]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65997

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Sensibo" %}

The optional battery voltage attribute has been removed from the climate entity.
If you used this attribute in your automations or scripts, you'll need
to adjust them to handle this change.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#64753]) ([documentation](/integrations/sensibo))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#64753]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/64753

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SimpliSafe" %}

SimpliSafe no longer accepts the, previously deprecated, `system_id` parameter
in service calls; automations and scripts calling those services now require a
`device_id` parameter instead.

([@bachya] - [#65483]) ([documentation](/integrations/simplisafe))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#65483]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65483

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Sonarr" %}

Sonarr v2 is no longer supported and has been deemed End of Life by its
developers since early 2021. Please upgrade to Sonarr v3 to continue
using the Sonarr integration.

{% details "Twitch" %}

The old Twitch API, this integration previously relied on, is shutting down soon.

Therefore, this release updated the Twitch integration to support the new API,
and now requires a `client_secret` as well as a `client_id`, and new OAuth
tokens need to be issued with the `user:read:subscriptions` scope.

{% details "Updater" %}

The Updater integration has been deprecated; other integrations have replaced
all its functionality. It is no longer a part of `default_config`,
and if you have the `updater` integration defined directly in your YAML
configuration, please remove it.

- For the `binary_sensor.updater` entity, you can set up the
  [Version integration](/integrations/version/) with the
  "Home Assistant Website" source to get the same functionality back.
- The configuration options `reporting` and `include_used_components` for
  the `updater:` configuration entry was deprecated in 2021.4.
  If you still want to share that,
  please use the new [Analytics integration](/integrations/analytics/).

{% details "Viessmann ViCare" %}

The sensor `solar power production` has been removed. This sensor was
a collection of multiple values.

Instead, we now provide four new sensors that each provides the data as single
value:

- `solar power production today`
- `solar power production this week`
- `solar power production this month`
- `solar power production this year`

You might need to adapt your automations or scripts to this change.
The stale restored sensor can be safely removed.

{% details "XBee" %}

The Xbee integration has been disabled due to the third-party library
we depend on not being compatible with Python 3.10.

Home Assistant is working towards adding support for Python 3.10, and
we had to disable this integration now to be able to get our development and
testing environments upgraded.

{% details "Z-Wave JS" %}

The `zwave_js.ping` service is now deprecated in favor of a new ping `button`
entity. You can replace any `zwave_js.ping` service calls in your automation
with a `button.press` call against the new entity with no change in
functionality.

The `zwave_js.ping` service will be removed in a future release of Home Assistant.

---

With this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance.

- If you use the zwave_js add-on, you need to have at least version `0.1.54.`.
- If you use the Z-Wave JS 2 MQTT add-on, you need to have at least version `0.35.2`.
- If you use the zwavejs2mqtt Docker container, you need to have at least version `6.5.2`.
- If you run your own Docker container, or some other installation method,
  you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance to at least `1.15.0`.

Your Z-Wave controllers will no longer get a node status sensor. While this is
technically a breaking change, in practice it should not be because the
controller is always alive.

## Updates for custom integration developers

If you are a custom integration developer, we have some updates in this
release that you may want to take into account for your integration.

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject.
Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Integration dependencies and Python pip" %}

In November 2020, with the release of Python pip 20.3, a new dependency
resolver was introduced in pip, which is more strict.

Home Assistant held back supporting the new pip version because of the
large number of dependencies we have, it took time for us to adjust to this
change. Meanwhile, Python pip would only warn for conflicts.

As we have resolved almost all dependency conflicts, we have now lifted
the pip version pinning, and thus now use the newer and stricter pip version.

If you use external dependencies in your custom integration, you might be
impacted by the new pip resolver. Your dependencies (and their version ranges)
must be compatible with the dependencies Home Assistant has; otherwise,
the installation of your custom integration will not succeed.

You can find more information on the new dependency resolver in Python pip here:

<https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#changes-to-the-pip-dependency-resolver-in-20-3-2020>

{% enddetails %}

{% details "async_timeout()" %}

We now use version 3.8+ of `aiohttp`, which requires `async_timeout` 4.0+
which has multiple breaking changes:

- `async_timeout.timeout` drops the `loop=` keyword arg.
- `async_timeout.current_task` has been removed.
- The `timeout.remaining` property has been removed.
- The `timeout.timeout` property has been removed.

Previously we had a backward-compatible layer in Home Assistant to
ease this change, which has now been removed.

([@frenck] - [#65732])

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#65732]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/65732

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Helper: get_url()" %}

If a user has the `http` integration configured to use SSL,
it only accepts HTTPS traffic. This means that the internal URL needs
to be set to use HTTPS too, and for the certificate to be valid,
this needs to be a domain name.

A lot of integrations that we send the URL to will fail if the
certificate is not valid (ie. Sonos, Cast).

To help the user get this right, the default for the `get_url` helper
will now prefer the external address if SSL is configured.

This has a higher chance of being correct, delivering a better out-of-the-box
experience to a larger group of users.

[#66039]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66039

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Helper: split_entity_id()" %}

`split_entity_id` will now raise a `ValueError` if the passed value
does not follow the basic entity ID format
(`<domain>.<object id>`).

Previously it could return a list with a single item.

[#66835]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/66835

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Sensors with date/time" %}

When using `datetime` and `date` device classes in sensors, the returned
native value must (respectively) be a datetime or date Python object.

Returning an iso formatted date(time) string in these cases was
previously deprecated and the fallback/backward compatibility has now
been removed.

([@frenck] - [#65734])

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#65734]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/665734062

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Zero-configuration networking (zeroconf)" %}

Currently, zeroconf returns IPv4 addresses in the `host` field. If there were
no advertised IPv4 addresses, the discovery would fail. For example,
a specific manufacturer's Thread Border Router advertised devices as
IPv6-only zeroconf services.

IPv6-only devices can now be discovered and an IPv6 address will
be present in the `host` property for those devices.

Developers who need to filter discovered devices by IP address version
should use `homeassistant.util.network.is_ipv4_address` or
`homeassistant.util.network.is_ipv6_address` to reject zeroconf
discoveries they do not want.
