## Connect and use your existing network storage

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Include share as mount usage option (#16636) @ludeeus
- Add dialog to change default backup location (#16610) @ludeeus
- Add UI for network mounts (#16357) @ludeeus

{% enddetails %}

Do you have a network storage in your home? Like a QNAP or Synology NAS?
This release add the ability to add and use that storage with Home Assistant!

This long and highly requested feature, is now available when you are running
the Home Assistant Operating System. In the {% my storage title="**Settings** > **System** > **Storage**" %}
menu, you can now find a whole new set of controls to connect to your storage
and use it to, for example, use as your network share as a media source
in Home Assistant.

Even better... You can use it as a target for your backups, so that when
Home Assistant creates a backup for you, it will be "off-site".

## Integrations dashboard & pages

The integrations dashboard has gotten a major overhaul!

There have been quite some usability issues with the previous version of the
integration dashboard. For example, if you use [ESPHome] with many devices,
you are undoubtedly familiar with the annoying scrolling in that little card. Or,
big error messages stretching those cards out, messing up the whole page.

This release brings in a whole new integrations dashboard that addresses many
of these issues, aiming to provide a cleaner and more consistent experience.

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/integrations-dashboard.png' alt='Screenshot showing the look and feel of the new integrations dashboard.'>

Device base integrations, like ESPHome, are combined: no more scrolling.
A failing integration does not stretch the layout and no longer makes the
layout "jump" during retries. Custom integrations and integrations relying
on the cloud are now more visibly marked.

Selecting the cog icon on the integration card will bring you to a brand new
integrations page, showing all information about integration:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/integration-page.png' alt='Screenshot showing an integration page, in this case, the integration page of ESPHome.'>

In the above example, the ESPHome integration page shows all devices
this integration has. All the information and options, previously squashed into
the integration dashboard, are now available here.

These brand new integration pages are helpful in other places in Home Assistant.
For example, the device pages can now link back directly to the integration
that provided it.

## Light entity dialog improvements, with favorite colors

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Light more info enhancement (#16673) @piitaya
- Update more info light actions (#16512) @piitaya
- New color picker for HS and color temp (#16549) @piitaya
- Update default colors for more info light favorite colors (#16688) @piitaya
- Add button bar for light modes (#16683) @piitaya

{% enddetails %}

Recently we introduced new controls in the light entity dialog, this release
iterates on the design by adding new controls and adding favorite colors.

<p class='img'>
<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5878303/242213802-301417be-65a5-40b3-aa32-25c3811e9e46.png'></a>
Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.

</video>
Temporary screenrecording that needs to be replaced.
</p>

## Added to the entity dialog: last changed

By popular request, the information on when an entity was last changed has
been added back to the new entity information dialogs.

Not only that, [@piitaya] added a very nice easter egg! You can click on it
to toggle between the relative and absolute format!

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/toggle-last-changed.gif' alt='Screen recording demonstrating how to toggle between relative and absolute time.'>

## Related information

Which automation is using that blueprint? Well, Home Assistant can now tell you
that! On the {% my blueprints title="**Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** > **Blueprints**" %}
page, select the three dotted menu on any blueprint to discover which
automations are using that blueprint.

Not only that, if you accidentally remove a blueprint that is still in use,
Home Assistant will stop you from removing it and tell you which automations
still rely on it.

Hold on; there is more related! The related items in the entity information
dialog got improved as well. Told old list of links is gone, and it now shows
a way more modern view of all related items for an entity:

<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2023-06/related-information.png' alt='Screenshot of the improved related entity information dialog.'>

Notice how it nicely links back to the new integration page here too!

## Copy 'n paste support in the automation editor

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

Refs:

- Add cut / copy / paste support to automation & script editor (#16488) @karwosts
- https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/16488

{% enddetails %}

An amazing contribution by @karwosts this release, that adds cut, copy & paste
capabilities to the automation and script editors!

You can now copy and paste any trigger, condition, and action into different
places of your automation, and even past it into a different automation all
together!

<p class='img'>

## Python 3.11 and significant performance upgrades

This release ships running on Python 3.11! In case you are wondering, what is
that? Well, Python is the language the Core of Home Assistant is written in.

Why it matters? It is seriously faster! 🚀

If you run the Home Assistant Operating System or are using the Home Assistant
Container installation type: You won't have to do anything as we handle the
upgrade to Python 3.11 for you.

And that is not all in terms of performance. We've also upgraded internal parts,
including a newer SQLite version that should be faster. Oh! And, of course,
[@bdraco] has been all over the place to optimize a lot (a lot lot).

This release can be expected to be a lot faster (or less consuming) of resources
at runtime.

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco

## Matter 1.1

The Matter implementation within Home Assistant is now based on the freshly
released 1.1 version of the Matter standard. This brings a ton of stability
fixes and improvements, but unfortunately, no new features.

Thanks to [@Diegorro98], we do now have support for tilt covers! Besides that,
this Home Assistant release ships with several generic bugfixes and
optimizations; we've managed to squeeze out some additional performance to
make state updates for your Matter devices lightning-fast 🚀

All these stability improvements to both the Matter stack and our
implementation did not go unnoticed:

## Z-Wave

{% details "TODO" %}

- Make a story out of this
- Proof read/spelling/grammar

{% enddetails %}

There has been quite a bit of progress on Z-Wave in Home Assistant.

- Add entities for node statistics so that users can more easily troubleshoot RF issues in their network
- Add support for Window Covering CC which improves support for blind tilt devices (fixes iBlinds v3)
- Fix notification CC sensor and button names
- Proper Indicator CC support (certification requirement)
- Optimistic state updates for multilevel switch entities (specifically buttons and switches - certification requirement)
- Add entities for config parameters so they can be included in part of automations (they were already supported in device automations but entities will give users more flexibility)
- We added better support for z-wave devices related to energy generation

Z-Wave JS is now a platinum quality level integration 🏆

## New entities! Date, time, date/time

We welcome three new entity types in this release:
[`date`](/integrations/date), [`time`](/integrations/time) & [`datetime`](/integrations/datetime).

These entities allow integrations to provide date, time, or date/time input
controls from the UI. They are very similar to the [input datetime](/integrations/input_datetime)
helper but are available for use by integrations.

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/blog/2023-06/new-date-time-entities.png' alt='Screenshot showing the new date & time entities introduced'></a>
How the new time, date, and date/time entities will look like on your dashboards.
</p>

They are so new that no integrations are using them yet, but you can expect
to see usage in (custom) integrations of these soon!

Thanks for creating those [@raman325]!

## Other noteworthy changes

There are much more easter bunnies in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:

- When using services in the UI (like in the automation editor), only options
  and settings available to the selected target devices & entities will be shown.
  This makes the UI much cleaner! Thanks, [@emontnemery] and [@bramkragten]!
- The [Roborock] integration (introduced in the previous release) received much
  love and now provides a wide range of new entities. Thanks [@Lash-L]!

## Breaking Changes

{% details "Python" %}

All Home Assistant versions, of which the Home Assistant project manages the
Python version for you, have been upgraded to Python 3.11. This affects
the following installation types:

- Home Assistant Operating System
- Home Assistant Container
- Home Assistant Supervised

This might affect you when using custom integrations, as those must be
compatible with Python 3.11.

Furthermore, as of this release, Python 3.10 is deprecated, and support will
be removed in Home Assistant 2023.8. This **only** affects you if you are
running Home Assistant Core installation type in your own Python virtual
environment. Please update your Python version to Python 3.11.

If you run Home Assistant OS, Home Assistant Container, or Home Assistant
Supervised, we have taken care of this for you; you will be using Python 3.11
automatically on upgrade.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "APC UPS Daemon" %}

`sensor.ups_self_test_interval` sensor now properly splits unit "days" from the
raw data. Previously, it would show `7 days` as the sensor state.
Now it shows `7` with a unit "Days".

([@yuxincs] - [#93844]) ([documentation](/integrations/apcupsd))

[@yuxincs]: https://github.com/yuxincs
[#93844]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93844

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Counter" %}

The `counter` entities no longer restore their previous manually set
configuration (using the - now deprecated - `counter.configure` service) on
Home Assistant startup. Instead, it will now use the configuration as set in
the helper configuration in the UI (or as configured YAML, if used).

This behavior is removed, as it caused configuration issues, as the new
configuration was never applied again (but forever restored). This behavior was
out of the ordinary for Home Assistant and thus now standardized.

The value of the counter is still restored and available across Home Assistant
restarts.

([@frenck] - [#93344]) ([documentation](/integrations/counter))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#93344]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/93344

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Command Line" %}

The Command Line integration changes its YAML configuration format from
an old-style platform configuration to a more modern integration-style
configuration format.

For example, if you have a binary sensor configured previously as:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: command_line
    command: "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
```

That same binary sensor is now configured under the `command_line` integration
configuration as:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
command_line:
  - binary_sensor:
      command: "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
```

Note: While this is currently not yet a breaking change, it did raise questions
during our beta testing period. Hence we have added this as a breaking change
to provide more context.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs
integration has been removed.

D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plugs are now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% details "EDL21" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the EDL21
integration has been removed.

EDL21 is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "EZVIZ" %}

The binary sensor providing "upgrade available" information has been removed
and replaced by a new `update` entity. If you use the binary sensor in your
automations, scripts, or dashboards, you will need to adjust them to
this change.

{% details "Frontier Silicon" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Frontier Silicon
integration has been removed.

Frontier Silicon is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Nest" %}

The Google Nest YAML configuration has been fully removed. You should ensure you
have imported your configuration and credentials into the UI before upgrading.

Nest Desktop or OOB authentication, which was previously disabled by Google,
has now been removed.

[@allenporter]: https://github.com/allenporter
[#92311]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92311

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IBM Watson TTS" %}

Home Assistant was still using the legacy Python pip package resolver, which
has been removed. Due to upstream package conflicts, the IBM Watson TTS
integration has been disabled.

The upstream project providing the libraries used has been notified repeatedly
in, at least, the past two years; unfortunately, without response. We had no
other choice to disable disabling this integration.

([@frenck] - [#92124]) ([documentation](/integrations/watson_tts))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#91492]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92124

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IHC Controller" %}

The default unit of measurement for manually set up sensors from IHC has been
removed. Home Assistant now assume all sensors with a unit of measurement set
are a number. IHC sensors can be text, but because of the default unit of
measurement, there is currently no way to get text sensors from IHC working.

This is a breaking fix because if you currently have temperature sensors
without a unit of measurement set, you will have to set this for the sensors.

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LG Netcast" %}

LG Netcast media players no longer have fake (assumed) `playing` or `paused`
states, and those are replaced with the `on` state.

If you used the `playing` or `paused` state in your automations, you will need
to update them to match this change.

{% details "Meteorologisk institutt (Met.no)" %}

The weather forecast provided by the weather entity has changed. The current
day has been added to the forecast. If your automation or scripts relied
on the first day to be tomorrow, you would need to adjust.

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT sensor configurations that still use `last_reset_topic` will fail. The
support was deprecated in Home Assistant 2021.11 and is now removed. Users
should use ` last_reset_value_template` instead.

{% details "Salda Smarty" %}

Home Assistant was still using the legacy Python pip package resolver, which
has been removed. Due to upstream package conflicts, the Salda Smarty
integration has been disabled.

The upstream project providing the libraries used has been notified repeatedly
in, at least, the past two years; unfortunately, without response. We had no
other choice than to disable this integration.

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

On/Off properties for the Indicator CC are no longer discovered as entities.

They were previously discovered as sensor entities which were not useful in
cases where you wanted to change these values, and you would need to change
the value for all three On/Off properties simultaneously in order for them to
work, which wasn't supported with our existing discovery model.

For devices with the `Entry control` generic device class, the `Door lock mode`
config parameter no longer gets created as a `sensor` entity and will instead
get created as a `select` entity.
