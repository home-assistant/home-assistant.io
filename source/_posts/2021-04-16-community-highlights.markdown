For me personally a small milestone: itâ€™s already the 10th community highlight
that I have written. Please let me know in the comments what you think. Some
interesting things popped up again around our community, that I thought was
worth sharing.

Do you want to share something for the next edition?

## Blueprint of the week

It may have happened to everyone, the washing machine has finished and you have
completely forgotten to take it out. We could probably do something with that
with a blueprint.

With the blueprint from [Sbyx](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/sbyx) you
put a smart plug on the washing machine and you get a notification when the
laundry is ready. Read more about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or
install this automation in your instance with a click on the My button!

{% my blueprint_import badge blueprint_url="https://gist.github.com/sbyx/6d8344d3575c9865657ac51915684696" %}

Bonus side effect: if your smart plug can measure energy, you also immediately
know what it uses and how much a wash has cost you. Give it a try!


## Battery state card

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/maxwroc/battery-state-card" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-04-16-community-highlights/battery.png'
            alt="Preview from battery state card"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:10px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Do you want to keep an eye on all your battery powered devices? Then try
the [battery state card](https://github.com/maxwroc/battery-state-card) from
[maxwroc](https://github.com/maxwroc), so that you can see by means of a color
which device is almost empty and it's time for a battery replacement.

## Lovelace Dashboard

Also this week we have a new Lovelace dashboard for the necessary portion of
inspiration ðŸ˜„ This time it has become that of [FreakLikeMe0991](https://www.reddit.com/user/FreakLikeMe0991/),
which, like last week's dashboard, mainly focuses on the use from a mobile device.

<blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created="1618574623"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/mpiqak/new_3_click_mobile_dashboard_work_in_progress/">New &gt;3 Click Mobile Dashboard - Work in Progress</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant">r/homeassistant</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><br>

Would you also like your dashboard to be in the community highlight? Drop it
on [Reddit][reddit] and maybe I'll pick it out for the next edition.

## Holodeck Project

We also came across a very cool project on our [community forum][community] namely
the Holodeck, made by [smowk](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/smowk): a smart
assistant in your kitchen. It projects images (like a Lovelace dashboard or cooking
video) onto your kitchen cupboard and could be operated by voice. You can read a lot
more about it [here][community_project].
