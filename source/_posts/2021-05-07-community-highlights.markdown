Damn! We are already at the 20th edition of the Home Assistant Community
Highlights! Some interesting things popped up around our community, we
thought was worth sharing.

Do you want to share something for the next edition?

## Blueprint of the week
------

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/deconz-simple-alarm-control-panel-blueprint/305397" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-05-07-community-highlights/keypad.jpg'
            alt="Zigbee alarm Keypad"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:60%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Recently Home Assistant has received support for the use of alarm keypads
with deCONZ, which works with an alarm control panel entity and the `deconz_alarm_event`.

Therefore this week's blueprint is that of [Robban](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/Robban),
with which you can use a physical (Zigbee) keypad to switch your alarm on
or off.

Keep in mind: the support in deCONZ rest plugin is still in an **alpha** stage.

Try it out! Read more about it on the [community forum][week_blueprint] or
install this automation in your instance with a click on the My button!

## Lovelace Dashboard
------

Also this week we have a new Lovelace dashboard for the necessary portion
of inspiration 💡 This time it has become that of [StreetInevitable5427](https://www.reddit.com/user/StreetInevitable5427/),
a beautiful Neon UI that looks so sleek that you would love to hang it
on your wall 🖼️

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/n4xnp3/i_made_neon_ui_for_my_tablet_does_it_have" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-05-07-community-highlights/dashboard.jpg'
            alt="Preview of the dashboard"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:80%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Take also a look at the [original post][dashboard] on Reddit. Would you
like your dashboard to be in the community highlight? Drop it on
[Reddit][reddit] and maybe I'll pick it out for the next edition.

## Browser Extension
------

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://github.com/bokub/home-assistant-extension" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-05-07-community-highlights/browser.png'
            alt="Home Assistant Browser Extension"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

Fresh off the press, we came across something really cool on
the [community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-browser-extension/305992).

[bokub](https://github.com/bokub) has made browser extensions for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/home-assistant/hpoiflhmfklhfcfpibmdmpeonphmdbda)
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/home-assistant/) with
which you can display a Lovelace dashboard in your browser and thus quickly
switch a light, for example.

## ESPHome 1.17
------

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">
    <a href="https://esphome.io/changelog/v1.17.0.html" target="_blank">
        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-05-07-community-highlights/esphome.png'
            alt="ESPHome changelog"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>

A new version of [ESPHome][esphome] has also been released this week! 🥳

In particular, I would like to point out the new [pulse_meter](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/pulse_meter.html)
component, which is ideal for if you want to measure all your energy via a
pulse LED on your smart meter or when you want to read what your water
consumption is.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pulse meter component is also what I’ve used for the hardware I’ve been working on. I’ve made a range of improvements since the last time I shared it. Now including a status LED so it’s easy to check if it’s working. <a href="https://t.co/GwaVZS0HQj">pic.twitter.com/GwaVZS0HQj</a></p>&mdash; Klaas Schoute (@klaasnicolaas) <a href="https://twitter.com/klaasnicolaas/status/1389683162683518979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

By combining measuring how many pulses there are within a time frame and
the time between each pulse, you get even better accurate readings!
