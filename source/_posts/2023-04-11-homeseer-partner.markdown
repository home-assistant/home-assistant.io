HomeSeer is now a member of the Works with Home Assistant partner program and they are committed to ensuring that their Z-Wave smart products are up to date and ready to use in Home Assistant.

HomeSeer products are all Z-Wave Plus certified. Their smart dimmer/switches offer convenient RGB LEDs that may be programmed with automations to glow or blink 7 different colors when things happen in your home. The switches also support multi-tap actions for triggering automations and scenes.

HomeSeer offers an AC powered Z-Wave multi-sensor that also includes an RGB LED for status updates. Additional Z-Wave products include a motion sensor, leak sensor, door/window sensor, floodlight sensor, and motorized water valve.

HomeSeer Z-Wave devices work locally and integrate seamlessly with the Z-Wave integration in Home Assistant (Z-Wave interface required). As all connectivity is happening locally, status updates and control of your devices happen instantly in Home Assistant.

With automatic firmware updates via Home Assistant we will continue to provide the best user experience for their devices.

PS: Weâ€™re actively working on easing the integration of the HomeSeer [Z-NET G3](https://shop.homeseer.com/collections/z-wave-products/products/z-net-g3-remote-z-wave-interface) into Home Assistant
