I've said it before, but Home Assistant would be nothing without its community. That's why we decided this year to focus our anniversary celebration on acknowledging and thanking our amazing community. It's fitting as 2024 was the year we added a dedicated community manager, [Missy Quarry](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/an-introduction-your-new-community-social-media-manager/693623), who hosted this celebration of *you* in our [11th Anniversary live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE8yFUvQ2e4).

Missy co-hosted the stream with creator and Home Assistant community member Andrej Broz, better known as [Bearded Tinker](https://www.youtube.com/c/BeardedTinker). Together they threw a barrage of questions at [Frenck](https://github.com/frenck) and [myself](https://github.com/balloob) - we didn't see any of them ahead of time so our responses don't get any more real than that. It was a lot of fun, and there was even a little announcement slipped in there, so [please check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE8yFUvQ2e4).

We can't thank our community enough for the past 11 years. You are the engine driving forward Home Assistant. You put in your spare time to test, fix, build, and share your ideas. You fund our work by subscribing to [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/), which allows us to devote our full attention to you, and never have to answer to a bunch of investors. We couldn't do it without you.
