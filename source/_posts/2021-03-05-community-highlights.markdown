The 11th edition of the Home Assistant Community Highlights! Some interesting
things popped up around our community, we thought was worth sharing.

From now on we will also highlight a cool blueprint that we encountered on the
[Blueprint exchange][blueprints]. Do you want to share something for the next edition?

## Blueprint of the week

Do you have an IP camera in Home Assistant instance and do you no longer want to miss
who is at the door? Then you could try the camera snapshot Blueprint from 
[vorion](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/vorion). You can also indicate to which
device you would like to receive a notification with a photo.
[Try it out!](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/send-camera-snapshot-notification-on-motion/254565)

## Solar weather station in birdhouse

Spring is approaching, so it's a good time to start building a birdhouse üê¶, so why not
immediately turn it into a weather station? With [the manual](https://www.martinvdm.nl/2020/08/03/solar-weather-station-in-birdhouse/)
from Martin, you can make your own weather (birdhouse) station that works with ESPHome.

## Outdoor pathway light

Do you have a garden and do you want to create lighting along the paths? Maybe the
garden lighting tutorial from [KidA001](https://www.reddit.com/user/KidA001/) will give you some inspiration to
[get started](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/lt40gb/made_my_own_outdoor_pathway_lights_with_esphome/) with this.

## PoE powered stack light

Looking for a creative way to display the status of your Home Assistant instance?
For example: there is a new Core update, too much RAM is being used or your instance
is no longer online? Plenty of options to bind to each color segment.

So let yourself be inspired with the PoE stack light from Karl and start
[building](https://karlquinsland.com/2021/02/poe-powered-stack-light/).
